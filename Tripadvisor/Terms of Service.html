The Services are offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance of the terms, conditions and notices set forth below (collectively, this &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and represent that you have read and understood its terms.

If you do not accept all of these terms and conditions, you are not authorised to use the Services. If you have a Tripadvisor account and wish to terminate this Agreement, you can do so at any time by closing your account and no longer accessing or using the Services (a description of how to do so is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/hc/en-gb/articles/200615117-How-do-I-close-my-member-account-"><strong>here</strong></a>).</p>

<p>Any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, data, code or other materials or arrangements of materials that you can view on, access or otherwise interact with through the Services shall be referred to as &ldquo;Content&rdquo;. The terms &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tripadvisor&rdquo; refer to Tripadvisor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company located in the United States of America (&ldquo;Tripadvisor&rdquo;). &ldquo;Services&rdquo; as defined above refers to those provided by Tripadvisor or our corporate affiliates (Tripadvisor and such entities, when one or more are referred to, shall be collectively defined as the &ldquo;Tripadvisor Companies&rdquo;).

Such notifications will typically be sent through newsletters and marketing communications and represent efforts to get to know you and your preferences better across our Services and those of our affiliates. In turn, this enables customisation of the services in line with those preferences.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;you&rdquo; refers to the individual, company, business organisation or other legal entity using the Services and/or contributing Content to them. The Content that you contribute, submit, transmit and/or post to or through the Services shall be referred to variously as &ldquo;your Content&rdquo;, &ldquo;Content of yours&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Content you submit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Services are provided solely to:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">

	<li>Assist travel, tourism and hospitality businesses in engaging with customers and potential customers, by way of free and/or paid-for services offered by or through the Tripadvisor Companies.</li>
</ol>

<p>We may change or otherwise modify this Agreement in the future in accordance with the terms and conditions herein, and you understand and agree that your continued access or use of the Services after such change signifies your acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement.

<p>We appreciate hearing from you. Please be aware that by providing your Content to or through the Services, be it via email, posting via any Tripadvisor synchronisation product, via the services and applications of others, or otherwise, including any of your Content that is transmitted to your Tripadvisor account by virtue of any Tripadvisor Companies product or service, reviews, questions, photographs or videos, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like contained in any of your Content, you grant the Tripadvisor Companies a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to (a) host, use, reproduce, modify, run, adapt, translate, distribute, publish, create derivative works from and publicly display and perform such Content of yours throughout the world in any media, now known or hereafter devised; (b) make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same; (c) to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make your Content shared on the Services available to other companies, organisations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such Content of yours on other media and services, subject to our Privacy Policy and this Agreement; and (d) use the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with such Content of yours.

You understand that the Tripadvisor Companies do not edit or control the user messages posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for such messaging.&nbsp; In particular, Tripadvisor does not edit or control users&rsquo; Content that appears on the websites.&nbsp; The Tripadvisor Companies nevertheless reserve the right to remove without notice any such messaging or other Content from the Services, where they believe in good faith that such Content breaches this Agreement or otherwise believe the removal is reasonably necessary to safeguard the rights of the Tripadvisor Companies and/or other users of the Services. Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/hc/en-gb"><strong>Help Center</strong></a>&nbsp;to make your objections.&nbsp; By using any Interactive Areas, you expressly agree only to submit Content of yours that complies with Tripadvisor&rsquo;s published guidelines, as are in force at the time of submission and made available to you by Tripadvisor.&nbsp; You expressly agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any Content of yours that:</p>

As a provider of interactive services, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense.</p>

<p>Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally.</p>

<p><a id="Restricting TripAdvisor’s Licence Rights" name="Restricting TripAdvisor’s Licence Rights" style="background-size: 16px;"><strong><u>Restricting Tripadvisor&rsquo;s Licence Rights</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong>You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies&rsquo; use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a &ldquo;Restricted Licence&rdquo;).&nbsp; You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Settings-cs"><strong>here</strong></a>&nbsp;(note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the &ldquo;Standard Licence&rdquo;) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a &ldquo;Restricted Licence&rdquo; as to the balance of your Content as defined below:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies&rsquo; licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services.&nbsp; Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies&rsquo; licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/hc/en-gb/articles/200615117-How-do-I-close-my-member-account-"><strong>here</strong></a>).&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others.&nbsp; In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our &ldquo;Trips&rdquo; feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made &quot;<em>public</em>&quot; and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a &ldquo;Restricted Licence&rdquo;.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme.</li>

By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already.</p>

<p>By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our&nbsp;<a href="https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/UK-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies&rsquo; booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies&rsquo; booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorised to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated.</p>

<p>AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES&rsquo; BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS.</p>

<p>When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our&nbsp;<a href="https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/UK-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation.</p>

<p>The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation.</p>

<p><a id="Third-Party Suppliers." name="Third-Party Suppliers." style="background-size: 16px;"><strong>Third-Party Suppliers.</strong></a>&nbsp;The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies&rsquo; websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies&rsquo; sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services.</p>

<p>If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier&rsquo;s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier&rsquo;s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers.</p>

<p>The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the &ldquo;Links to Third-Party Sites&rdquo; section below.</p>

<p><a id="International Travel." name="International Travel." style="background-size: 16px;"><strong>International Travel.</strong></a>&nbsp;When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.</p>

<p>For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller&rsquo;s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination.</p>

<p>It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.</p>

<p>Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.state.gov/" target="_blank">www.state.gov</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tsa.gov/" target="_blank">www.tsa.gov</a>,<a href="http://www.dot.gov/" target="_blank">www.dot.gov</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.faa.gov/" target="_blank">www.faa.gov</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">www.cdc.gov</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.treas.gov/ofac" target="_blank">www.treas.gov/ofac</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.customs.gov/" target="_blank">www.customs.gov</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fair">20. Fair usage policy</h2>
<p>To ensure the best browsing experience for our users, your potential buyers, we ask that you only create one advertisement per property.</p>
<p>We only allow one property per advertisement. This ensures that your property will appear in the correct search and helps them sell/rent quicker. Your advertisement may be removed if:</p>
<p>a. you have more than one property in the listing;</p>
<p>b. you have multiple listings for one property across several sections; and/or</p>
<p>c. you have multiple listings for one property across several counties.</p>
<p>This will make it easier for a potential buyer/tenant to find your property. It will also make it easier for the advertisement to be removed when the property is no longer available. If this policy is not complied with, we reserve the right to remove the offending advertisement(s) from the Website without notice to you and without refund.</p>

<h2 id="reporting">21. Reporting breaches</h2>

<h2 id="responsibility">23. Responsibility</h2>

<p id="15-4">15.4. You understand and agree that Barqo does not act as an insurer or as an agent with power to enter into contracts for you as an Owner. If a Potential Hirer requests a booking of your Boat, any agreement you enter into with that Potential Hirer is between you and the Potential Hirer and Barqo is not a party to that agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Barqo serves as the limited agent of the Owner for the purpose of accepting payments from Hirers on behalf of the Owner and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Owner in accordance with the Terms.</p>

<p id="15-5">15.5. When you create an Advertisement, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Boat, including requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to hire your Boat. Any Member wishing to hire Boats included in Advertisements with such requirements must meet these requirements. We do not guarantee that any Member claiming to meet any requirements in fact does so and it is your sole responsibility to determine whether or not a Member does meet your requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the “Owners” section of the Services.</p>

<p id="15-6">15.6. If you are an Owner, Barqo may make certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to hire your Boat to. You acknowledge and agree that, as an Owner, you are solely responsible for your own acts and omissions. Barqo does not represent or guarantee that any person you decide to hire your Boat to, whether or not on the basis of any tools made available by Barqo, is qualified or suitable to hire your Boat.</p>

<h2 id="16">16. Bookings</h2>

<p id="16-1">16.1. If you are an Owner and a booking is requested for your Boat via the Services, you may be required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested or the booking request may be automatically cancelled. When a booking is requested via the Services, we will share with you (a) the first and last name of the Potential Hirer who has requested the booking, and (b) a link to the Potential Hirer’s Barqo Account profile page so that you can view the information on that page before confirming or rejecting the booking. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of a Boat within such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Barqo for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Potential Hirer’s credit card and any pre-authorisation of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Potential Hirer, Barqo will send you an email message via the Services confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Services.</p>

<p id="16-2">16.2. The fees displayed in each Advertisement are comprised of the Hire Charges and the Late Charges. Where applicable, Tax may be charged in addition to the Hire Charges and Late Charges, such will clearly be stated in the Advertisement. The Hire Charges, Late Charges and applicable Tax are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”. The amounts due and payable by a Hirer solely relating to an Owner’s Boat which are actually collected by Barqo are the “Hire Charges”. Please note that it is the Owner and not Barqo which determines the Hire Charges. The Hire Charges may include a cleaning fee, pre-paid fuel charges, or additional training costs, at the Owner’s discretion.</p>

<p id="16-3">16.3. Owners, not Barqo, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed bookings and making available any Boats reserved through the Services. If you, as a Hirer, choose to enter into a transaction with an Owner for the booking of a Boat, you agree and understand that you will be entering into a contract with the Owner and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Boat imposed by the Owner, all of which will be notified to you before you are required to commit to that contract. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Barqo, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such contracts, that Barqo is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its obligations hereunder to pay Hire Charges and Late Charges to the applicable Owner, Barqo disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Barqo is not a party to the agreement between you and the Owner, Barqo acts as the Owner’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Owner. Upon your payment of amounts to Barqo which are due to the Owner, your payment obligation to the Owner for such amounts is fulfilled, and Barqo is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Barqo’s Service Fees, to the Owner. In the event that Barqo does not remit any such amounts to an Owner, such Owner will have recourse for such amounts only against Barqo.</p>

<p id="16-4">16.4. You, the Hirer, agree to pay Barqo the Hire Charges and Late Charges for any booking requested in connection with your Barqo Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Owner.

Once Barqo receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Owner, Barqo will collect the Hire Charges and Late Charges in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Barqo cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Hirer by his or her bank related to Barqo’s collection of the Hire Charges or Late Charges, and Barqo disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>

<p id="16-5">16.5. In connection with a requested booking, a Prospective Hirer will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Barqo or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Barqo for Hire Charges and Late Charges for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Barqo Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Website – e.g. by credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Barqo or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Services. You also authorize Barqo to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused to a Boat as contemplated in <a href="#17">paragraph 17</a>. If you are directed to Barqo’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and, if applicable their privacy policy, before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p>

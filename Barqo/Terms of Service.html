<h1>B. ADVERTISEMENTS AND BOOKINGS</h1>

<h2 id="15">15. Advertisements</h2>

<p id="15-1">15.1. You may create an Advertisement if you are both an Owner and a Member. You will be asked a number of questions about the Boat to be advertised, including the location, size, features, availability, qualifications /experience required, restrictions on use, and pricing. You agree that Advertisements will be made publicly available via the Services. Other Members will be able to hire your Boat via the Services based upon the information provided in your Advertisement. Once an Owner and a Hirer have agreed the hire of Boat the price and other terms agreed for that hire may only be altered with the consent of both the Owner and the Hirer.</p>

<p id="15-2">15.2. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Advertisements you post. You represent and warrant to us and to all other Members that any Advertisement you post, the booking of a Boat advertised in an Advertisement posted by you, and the use by a Hirer in accordance with the agreed terms of the hire of any Boat advertised in an Advertisement posted by you, you will:</p>

<p id="15-2-1">15.2.1. not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, including any person who has financed the purchase of the Boat;</p>

<p id="15-2-2">15.2.2. be in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including laws relating to the commercial use of Boats and marina regulations.</p>

<p id="15-3">15.3 Barqo assumes no responsibility for an Owner’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations and Owner hereby indemnifies Barqo of any claims and/or liability, from either a third party or Owner arising out of or in connection with the non-compliance of Owner with any applicable laws, rules and regulations, including laws, rules and regulations relating to operating permits and mooring permits. Barqo reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Advertisement which Barqo, in its reasonable opinion, considers to be in breach of these Terms or otherwise objectionable or harmful to Barqo’s reputation.</p>

<p id="15-4">15.4. You understand and agree that Barqo does not act as an insurer or as an agent with power to enter into contracts for you as an Owner. If a Potential Hirer requests a booking of your Boat, any agreement you enter into with that Potential Hirer is between you and the Potential Hirer and Barqo is not a party to that agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Barqo serves as the limited agent of the Owner for the purpose of accepting payments from Hirers on behalf of the Owner and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Owner in accordance with the Terms.</p>

<p id="15-5">15.5. When you create an Advertisement, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Boat, including requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to hire your Boat. Any Member wishing to hire Boats included in Advertisements with such requirements must meet these requirements. We do not guarantee that any Member claiming to meet any requirements in fact does so and it is your sole responsibility to determine whether or not a Member does meet your requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the “Owners” section of the Services.</p>

<p id="15-6">15.6. If you are an Owner, Barqo may make certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to hire your Boat to.

Barqo does not represent or guarantee that any person you decide to hire your Boat to, whether or not on the basis of any tools made available by Barqo, is qualified or suitable to hire your Boat.</p>

<h2 id="16">16. Bookings</h2>

<p id="16-1">16.1. If you are an Owner and a booking is requested for your Boat via the Services, you may be required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested or the booking request may be automatically cancelled. When a booking is requested via the Services, we will share with you (a) the first and last name of the Potential Hirer who has requested the booking, and (b) a link to the Potential Hirer’s Barqo Account profile page so that you can view the information on that page before confirming or rejecting the booking. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of a Boat within such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Barqo for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Potential Hirer’s credit card and any pre-authorisation of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Potential Hirer, Barqo will send you an email message via the Services confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Services.</p>

<p id="16-2">16.2. The fees displayed in each Advertisement are comprised of the Hire Charges and the Late Charges. Where applicable, Tax may be charged in addition to the Hire Charges and Late Charges, such will clearly be stated in the Advertisement. The Hire Charges, Late Charges and applicable Tax are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”. The amounts due and payable by a Hirer solely relating to an Owner’s Boat which are actually collected by Barqo are the “Hire Charges”. Please note that it is the Owner and not Barqo which determines the Hire Charges. The Hire Charges may include a cleaning fee, pre-paid fuel charges, or additional training costs, at the Owner’s discretion.</p>

<p id="16-3">16.3. Owners, not Barqo, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed bookings and making available any Boats reserved through the Services. If you, as a Hirer, choose to enter into a transaction with an Owner for the booking of a Boat, you agree and understand that you will be entering into a contract with the Owner and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Boat imposed by the Owner, all of which will be notified to you before you are required to commit to that contract. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Barqo, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such contracts, that Barqo is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its obligations hereunder to pay Hire Charges and Late Charges to the applicable Owner, Barqo disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Barqo is not a party to the agreement between you and the Owner, Barqo acts as the Owner’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Owner. Upon your payment of amounts to Barqo which are due to the Owner, your payment obligation to the Owner for such amounts is fulfilled, and Barqo is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Barqo’s Service Fees, to the Owner. In the event that Barqo does not remit any such amounts to an Owner, such Owner will have recourse for such amounts only against Barqo.</p>

<p id="16-4">16.4. You, the Hirer, agree to pay Barqo the Hire Charges and Late Charges for any booking requested in connection with your Barqo Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Owner. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Owner’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Barqo, on behalf of the Owner, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorisation via your credit card for the Hire Charges or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one euro (€1) to verify your credit card. Once Barqo receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Owner, Barqo will collect the Hire Charges and Late Charges in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Barqo cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Hirer by his or her bank related to Barqo’s collection of the Hire Charges or Late Charges, and Barqo disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>

<p id="16-5">16.5. In connection with a requested booking, a Prospective Hirer will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Barqo or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Barqo for Hire Charges and Late Charges for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Barqo Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Website – e.g. by credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Barqo or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Services. You also authorize Barqo to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused to a Boat as contemplated in <a href="#17">paragraph 17</a>. If you are directed to Barqo’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and, if applicable their privacy policy, before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p>

<h2 id="17">17. Security Deposits</h2>

<p id="17-1">17.1. A security deposit will be specified in every Advertisement (“Security Deposit”). For all Security Deposits included in an Advertisement for a confirmed booking of a Boat, Barqo will, in its capacity as the payment agent of the Owner, use its reasonable endeavours to obtain a pre-authorisation of the Hirer’s credit card in the amount the Owner determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the commencement of the Hirer’s hire of the Boat. Barqo will also use its reasonable endeavours to address Owners’ requests and claims related to such Security Deposits, but Barqo is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Owners related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p>

<p id="17-2">17.2. A Security Deposit may be applied towards, and a Hirer’s credit card charged up to the amount of the Security Deposit for:</p>

<p id="17-2-1">17.2.1. the cost of making good any damage to a Boat for which a Hirer is responsible and which is not covered by the Insurance Policy, including damage up to the amount of any excess on the Insurance Policy for the respective Boat;</p>

<p id="17-2-2">17.2.2. any Late Charges payable by a Hirer.</p>

<p id="17-3">17.3. A Hirer’s liability for damage to a Boat is not limited to the amount of the Security Deposit provided by the Hirer. See <a href="#26">paragraph 26</a> below for further terms in relation to damage to Boats.</p>

<h2 id="18">18. Service Fees payable by Owners</h2>

<p id="18-1">18.1. In consideration for providing the Services, Barqo charges service fees to Owners (“Service Fees”). Service Fees are based upon a percentage of the amount of Hire Charges and Late Charges (if any), excluding any Tax. Where applicable, Value Added Tax and any other applicable Tax may also be charged to Owner in addition to the Service Fees. Service Fees are deducted from the Hire Charges before remitting the Hire Charges to the Owner, within 24 hours of when the Hirer checks in the applicable Boat at the end of the Actual Hire Period.</p>

<h1>C. BOAT HIRE TERMS</h1>

<h2 id="21">21. Hirer’s & Crew’s Competency</h2>

<p>The Hirer warrants and undertakes to the Owner that the Hirer and the Hirer’s crew have all necessary qualifications, experience, and competence to operate and navigate the Boat safely and in compliance with all applicable laws and are in possession of a boatmaster's licence ("vaarbewijs") if such is required. The Hirer shall, if requested, produce to the Owner or the Owner’s representative prior to the commencement of the Agreed Hire Period original or officially issued boatmaster's licence in relation to any qualifications the Hirer and/or the Hirer’s crew has or have claimed to possess in the Hirer’s Barqo Account profile page. Failure to produce any such licence may result in the Hirer being denied access to the Boat.</p>

<h2 id="22">22. Pre-Hire Inspection & Sea Trials</h2>

<p id="22-1">22.1. Prior to the commencement of the Agreed Hire Period, the Hirer may inspect the Boat in the company of the Owner or the Owner’s representative to assess the condition of the Boat and to satisfy the Hirer that the Boat is as described in the Advertisement the Hirer responded to or is otherwise in such condition as has been agreed between the Owner and the Hirer.</p>

<p id="22-2">22.2. Either the Hirer or the Owner (including the Owner’s representative) may require the other to undertake a sea trial of up to one hour to assess (in the case of the Hirer) the condition of the Boat and (in the case of the Owner or the Owner’s representative) the competency of the Hirer and the Hirer’s crew.</p>

<p id="22-6">22.6. If the Hirer does not accept delivery of the Boat within three hours from the start of the Agreed Hire Period and has not notified the Owner of Hirer’s intention to accept delivery later during the Agreed Hire Period, the Owner may terminate the Hire and shall be entitled to payment of such sums as would be payable under the cancellation policy of the Owner contained in the applicable Advertisement in the event of a cancellation by the Hirer on the day the Agreed Hire Period was due to commence.

<p id="26-2">26.2. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Barqo or through the Services or Collective Content, will create any warranty not expressly made herein, unless expressly made in any such advice or information.</p>

<p id="26-3">26.3. You are solely responsible for all of your communications and interactions with other users of the Services and with other persons with whom you communicate or interact as a result of your use of the Services, including any Owners or (Potential) Hirers.

<h2 id="27">27. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p id="27-1">27.1. You acknowledge and agree that, the entire risk arising out of or in connection with your access to and use of the Services and Collective Content, your Advertisement or booking of and use of any Boats via the Services, and any contact you have with other users of the Services whether in person or online remains with you. Neither Barqo nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Service and/or Collective Content will be liable for any direct or indirect damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with these Terms, from the use of or inability to use the Services and/or Collective Content, from any communications, interactions or meetings with other users of the Services or other persons with whom you communicate or interact as a result of your use of the Services, or from your Advertisement, booking, or use of any Boat via the Services, whether based on warranty, contract, unlawful act, product liability or any other legal basus, and whether or not Barqo has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

<p id="27-2">27.2. Except for our obligations to pay amounts due by Hirers to Owners pursuant to these Terms, in no event will Barqo’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the Services including from your Advertisement, booking or use of any Boat via the Services, or from the use of or inability to use the Services, or Collective Content and in connection with any Boat or interactions with any other Members, exceed the amounts you have paid for bookings via the Website, Application and Services as a guest in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or if you are an Owner, the amounts paid by Barqo to you in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or EUR 100.-, if no such payments have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the contract between Barqo and you.

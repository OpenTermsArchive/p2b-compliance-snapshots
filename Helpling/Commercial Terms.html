        <p class="content__row__headline">Registration by the Service Provider</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that, in determining whether to include you on the Site as a potential supplier of Services, we rely on the accuracy and completeness of the information supplied by you during the registration process.

        <br>

You shall indemnify us against all reasonable costs and expenses and any tax, penalty, fine or interest incurred or payable by us in connection with, or in consequence of, any such liability, deduction, contribution, assessment or claim, other than where such liability, deduction, contribution, assessment or claim arises out of our negligence or wilful default.

        <!-- Section 7 -->
        
        <p class="content__row__headline">Changes to these terms of use</p>

        <br>
        <p>These terms of use were last updated on June 15 2020.</p>
        
        <!-- Section 8 -->
        
        <p class="content__row__headline">Services</p>
        <p>If you accept a contract with a particular User, whether on a one-off or other basis, you agree to supply Services to that User in accordance with these terms of use. You acknowledge that, notwithstanding your obligations to us herein regarding the standard of such Services, you will contract direct with each User for the supply of Services and, in the event of a dispute with the User, your recourse is against the User and not us.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you cause any damage to a User’s property in the course of providing the Services to them, you will be fully responsible for such damage and will reimburse the User accordingly. We therefore recommend that, for so long as you are providing Services to Users, you take out and maintain in force with a reputable insurer appropriate general liability insurance cover in respect of any such damage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You promise that you have the necessary skills to supply the Services.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You shall supply the Services in accordance with a high degree of professionalism and the highest industry standards.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the provision of the Services and otherwise in connection with these terms of use.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You shall agree with the relevant User as to the provision and procurement of materials required by you to provide the Services to that User. We are not responsible for the provision of any tools, equipment or materials.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You acknowledge that we will notify you of any User cancellation by email and it is your responsibility to monitor your emails frequently.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you have to cancel a scheduled booking or are otherwise unable or unavailable to attend the agreed location to provide the Services requested, you must notify us and the relevant User by email or telephone as soon as possible and without undue delay.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you fail to attend the agreed location at the scheduled time of the visit, we reserve the right to charge you a non-attendance administration fee (as notified to you from time to time) to cover our reasonable costs arising as a result of the missed booking which we may, at our election, deduct from any amounts due to you from us.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You shall promptly notify us:</p>
        <ul class="checklist">
        <li>if, for any reason, you cannot attend any scheduled visit (in which case you must promptly notify the User also) or otherwise become unable or unavailable to supply the Services as contracted;</li>
        <li>if you receive any complaints from Users; and</li>
        <li>of any grievance that you may have in relation to Users.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>You shall attempt to resolve any complaint by a User directly with said User.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You shall provide reasonable co-operation to us in connection with these terms of use and comply with our reasonable requirements, including prompt provision of such information and documents as we may reasonably request in connection with these terms of use.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You shall only use User contact information insofar as is reasonably necessary to provide the Services. You shall keep such information confidential and shall delete it if requested to do so by us.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do not guarantee that you will receive any, or any particular level of, contracts or revenues from the arrangements contemplated by these terms of use.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do not carry out any checks on Users and cannot provide any guarantees as to the conduct of Users or the suitability or safety of their premises. You attend cleaning visits at your own risk. You must leave immediately if you have any concerns as to such matters.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By registering to use Helpling, you agree that all bookings between you and Users will be made through Helpling and that you will not supply any Services to any Users who have previously booked you through Helpling, or whose contact details you have received from us, other than through Helpling. If a User offers to engage or employ you to provide Services other than through Helpling, you must refuse such offer and notify us immediately. If you accept any such offer or if you make a similar offer to a User, we will immediately withdraw your right to use Helpling and you will be required to compensate us in respect of any losses we suffer as a result up to a maximum of £500.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You also agree not to supply any Services to any Users who have previously booked you through Helpling, or whose contact details you have received from us, for a period of six months after the date of termination of the legal agreement between us.</p>

        <p>You are free to set the amount you charge for the Services you provide to Users. Receipts for any payments received from Users will be issued automatically by Helpling on your behalf and will include your name and details.</p>

        <p> You agree not to disclose, divulge or communicate directly or indirectly to any third party any information regarding us, Helpling.co.uk or any Users (including their contact details) without our (or their, as applicable) prior written consent. You must not use any such information other than is necessary to provide the services requested by Users. </p>
        <p> We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms of use to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these terms of use. </p>
        <p> You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these terms of use to another person. However, at the approval of the User, you may sub-contract your obligations and work exclusively to other Helpling Service Providers. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms of use, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you. </p>
        <p> Each of the conditions of these terms of use operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect. </p>
        <p> These terms of use are not intended to confer rights on anyone other than you and us. </p>
        <p class="content__row__headline">Applicable law</p>
        <p> These terms of use, their subject matter and formation are governed by English law. </p>
        <p> The Courts of England and Wales will, subject to the paragraph below, have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising from, or related to, these terms of use. </p>
        <p> Nothing in the foregoing paragraph will limit our right to take proceedings against you in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor will the taking of proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude us from taking proceedings in any other jurisdiction, whether concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such other jurisdiction. </p>

<h1><strong>EPIC ONLINE SERVICES DEVELOPER AGREEMENT</strong></h1>

<p>LAST UPDATED 7th OF DECEMBER 2022</p>

<p>Epic has developed a set of online services for you to use in your Video Games. Epic intends to provide these services to you for use in your Video Games in the same manner and at the same level of quality as Epic expects for Epic’s own Video Games.</p>

<p>Epic offers two tiers of services: Live Services and Preview Services. Live Services are Services that Epic intends to offer on a long-term basis. Preview Services are early preview releases which are expected to change as Epic continues development and for which Epic is soliciting your feedback. All services are Live Services unless otherwise specified in the relevant Service Addendum.</p>

<p>Please read this Agreement carefully. It is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations related to your use of the SDK and related Services. You may only use these services if you comply with the terms of this Agreement. By clicking “Accept,” downloading or using the SDK, or accessing the Services, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not download or use the SDK or access any Services.</p>

<p>Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement. Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 12.</p>

<p>If your primary residence (or primary place of business, if you are a legal entity like a corporation or an academic institution) is in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games, Inc. If it is not in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games Commerce GmbH.<br />
<br />
You affirm that you are at least 13 years old or the age of digital consent in the country of your residence, whichever is higher.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>1. PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT</strong></strong></h2>

<p>The purpose of this Agreement is to establish terms regarding your use of the SDK and related Services. Accepting this Agreement enables you to access the Services listed in the Service Addendum for Standard Services below. You may access additional Services by accepting the applicable Service Addenda, which may include Service or feature-specific terms. This Agreement together with any Service Addenda and any documentation incorporated by reference constitute one single agreement.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>2. SERVICES</strong></strong></h2>

<p>2.1. During the term of this Agreement, Epic will make available the Services and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Services in substantially the same manner and level of quality that Epic provides with respect to services for its own games, taking into consideration whether such Services are Preview Services or Live Services.</p>

<p>2.2. Epic’s obligations under Section 2.1 are conditioned upon (a) your ongoing, good-faith cooperation to perform all tasks necessary, or reasonably requested by Epic, to integrate the SDK and ensure that your Video Games are compatible with the SDK and Services, and (b) your compliance with all applicable terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>2.3. If you do not use or access a particular Service for a period of one year or longer, upon thirty (30) days’ notice Epic may delete any data relating to such Service that is stored or maintained through the Service.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>3. LICENSE GRANT</strong></strong></h2>

<p>3.1. During the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and subject to your compliance with such terms and conditions, Epic hereby grants you a non-sublicensable, terminable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license only to: (a) use the Epic Materials internally to evaluate the Services for use in connection with your Video Games; (b) use the Epic Materials to integrate the Services in applications related to your Video Games, including by incorporating Distributable Code in your Video Games; and (c) distribute the Distributable Code, incorporated in object code format only as an inseparable part of your Video Games, to end users who are subject to an end user license agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Epic Materials.</p>

<p>3.2. All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by the terms of this Agreement. No license or other rights will be created hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.</p>

<p>3.3. Accounts and Credentials</p>

<p>3.3.1. In order to download the SDK or access the Developer Portal, you must set up an Account. You may not share or allow others to use your Account. You are responsible for the security of your Account. Use of your Account, including in the Developer Portal, is subject to Epic’s terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

<p>3.3.2. In order to use the Services, Epic may provide you with Credentials. You may only share Credentials with Licensed EOS Developers to utilize the Credentials in good faith to use the Services in connection with your Video Game. You agree not to share your Credentials with any third party except as permitted above.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>4. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS AND ACCEPTABLE USE</strong></strong></h2>

<p>4.1. You agree not to, and you will not permit any third party to:</p>

<p>(a) access the Services or Epic Materials except through the SDK, the Developer Portal, or as otherwise expressly authorized by Epic;</p>

<p>(b) use the SDK with any applications or software other than in connection with your Video Games;</p>

<p>(c) combine, distribute, or otherwise use the SDK with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the SDK be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement; or</p>

<p>(d) utilize Epic Materials or the Services:</p>

<p>(1) in any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation;</p>

<p>(2) to interfere with any third party’s access to any of the Epic Materials or the Services, intentionally or otherwise;</p>

<p>(3) to tamper with or circumvent technical restrictions on use, access, storage, or any function of the Services or Epic Materials, for example by using access Credentials you are not authorized to use; or</p>

<p>(4) in an unreasonable or excessive manner given the scope, nature, and content of your Video Game, for example to conduct a DDOS attack on the Services.</p>

<p>4.2. Epic reserves the right to immediately remove content stored or maintained through the Services or disable access to, suspend, or terminate the Services to comply with applicable law or if you are in violation of this Section 4 or any Service Addendum. You agree to provide information or other materials related to your use of the Services as reasonably requested by Epic to investigate the source of any problem with the Services or to verify your compliance with this Agreement.</p>

<p>4.3. Epic intends to be transparent in its management and enforcement of the restrictions above. Epic will keep you up-to-date and provide additional guidance on these issues through the Epic Online Services Acceptable Use Policy. In addition, technical documentation outlining how to use the SDK and the Services, including any technical restrictions on their use, is available on Epic’s documentation page.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>5. UPDATES AND AMENDMENTS</strong></strong></h2>

<p>5.1. Epic may release SDK Updates from time to time and make them available via the Developer Portal. Epic will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure each SDK Update is binary compatible with Video Games that integrate the prior version of the SDK. You will be expected to update your Video Games to use the SDK Update within three (3) years of its release. Beyond this time period, Epic intends to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure continued backward compatibility of any Live Services, but Epic does not have any obligation to support any prior version for more than three (3) years from the time it has received an SDK Update.</p>

<p>5.2. Epic may discontinue support for any Live Service upon three (3) years’ written notice to you.</p>

<p>5.3. Epic may introduce breaking changes to any Preview Service at any time upon prior written notice to you.</p>

<p>5.4. Epic may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion by providing notice to you or by providing you with digital access to the amended Agreement when you log in to the Developer Portal or download SDK Updates. You are not required to accept the amended Agreement. However, in order to use new SDK Updates or access new Services that Epic offers, you must accept the amended Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Epic may amend this Agreement with respect to the current version of the SDK or the current Services to comply with law or regulatory requirements, in which case Epic will provide reasonable notice to you.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong></strong></h2>

<p>6.1. Epic and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest including all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Epic Trademarks, Epic Materials, and the Services.

Please review each Service Addendum carefully for additional requirements relating to your use of Epic-Owned Data.</p>

<p>6.2. As between you and Epic, you (and your licensors, if any) retain all right, title, and interest including all Intellectual Property Rights in and to your Video Game(s) (excluding any Distributable Code and Epic Materials integrated therein) and Your Data. You grant Epic a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide license to use and reproduce Your Data solely for the purpose of providing the Services.

<h2><strong><strong>7. NOTICES</strong></strong></h2>

These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.</p>

<p>8.3. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in those states or jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to the full extent permitted by law.</p>

Epic shall have the right to assign any and all of its rights and obligations hereunder to any party.</p>

<p>13.6. Any act by Epic to exercise, or failure or delay in exercise of, any of its rights under this Agreement, at law or in equity will not be deemed a waiver of those or any other rights or remedies available in contract, at law or in equity.</p>

<p>13.7. Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, if any term of this Agreement is held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the term will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

<p>By using Epic Account Services, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Addendum. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Addendum, do not use Epic Account Services.</p>

<h2><strong>2. PERMITTED USE</strong></h2>

<p>2.1. You agree to only use the Service and/or Process Epic Account Data for the purpose of authenticating Users, providing Epic’s social features in connection with your Video Game(s), and assisting Users in making social connections across other services (collectively, the “Permitted Uses”). Unless required by applicable law, you agree not to use, retain, disclose, or otherwise Process Epic Account Data for any other purpose.</p>

<p>2.2. Epic Account Data is Epic-Owned Data, even when used or exposed with other Services and when created or modified through your Video Game.</p>

<p>2.3. You may only access Epic Account Data through the Service and in accordance with all relevant Epic policies and license agreements governing your use of the Service. An overview of relevant guidelines and policies can be found at <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs" target="_blank">https://dev.epicgames.com/docs</a></p>

<p>2.4. You may not collect data about Epic Accounts directly from Users or from any source other than through the Service. You may not proxy, request, or collect Epic Account access credentials.</p>

<p>2.5. If you choose to support Epic Accounts in your Video Game (either as sole account system or in conjunction with other account systems) then you agree to present Users per our guidelines with clear and conspicuous options to log into and out of their Epic Accounts through your Video Game, and allow Users without an Epic Account to create an Epic Account. Once a User has authenticated through the Service, you must clearly and conspicuously show the User that he or she is signed into the relevant Epic Account.</p>

<p>2.6. If your Video Game requires use of an Epic Account to access all features of the Video Game, this fact must be prominently displayed prior to the point of purchase and/or download.</p>

<p>2.7. You agree not to use the Service or access any Epic Account Data for any Video Game that is primarily directed to children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>2.8. Epic may provide different scopes of Epic Account Data you may request access to. You may only request access to scopes of Epic Account Data that you currently need in your Video Game for the Permitted Uses. You may not request access to scopes of Epic Account Data on the basis that it could be useful to you or your Video Game at some point in the future.</p>

<p>2.9. You must obtain explicit consent in your Video Game from a User before importing any of that User’s Epic Account Data for the purpose of making social connections across other services. A disclosure of this use of Epic Account Data in your privacy policy alone is insufficient. Consent to this use of Epic Account Data must not be required as part of your Video Game. You agree to provide a transparent and easily accessible mechanism for Users to withdraw their consent to your use of that User’s Epic Account Data for this purpose.</p>

<p>2.10. You agree not to sell, rent, license, release, disclose, disseminate, transfer, or otherwise make available, in whole or in part, any Epic Account Data to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. Such third parties include, but are not limited to, data brokers, ad networks, ad exchanges, and advertisers.</p>

<h2><strong>3. PRIVACY LAWS</strong></h2>

<p>3.1. You agree to use the Service and Process Epic Account Data solely in compliance with all applicable Privacy Laws. In the event a Privacy Law, enforcement action, investigation, litigation or claim, or any other circumstance, is reasonably likely to adversely affect your ability to comply with this Addendum or the Agreement, you agree to promptly notify Epic through the Developer Portal and take reasonable and appropriate steps to remedy any non-compliance, or promptly cease your use of the Service and Processing of any Epic Account Data.</p>

<p>3.2. Epic may suspend or revoke your access to, or use of, any or all of the Service or Epic Account Data if you have violated this Addendum.</p>

<p>3.3. You agree to maintain a publicly available and easily accessible privacy policy that (i) complies with Privacy Laws; (ii) comprehensively, clearly, and accurately describes your Processing of Epic Account Data; and (iii) provides contact information for data protection inquiries. Your privacy policy must be consistent with this Addendum and the Agreement. You agree that you will provide an accurate link to your publicly available Privacy Policy to Epic for inclusion in the consent flow interface.</p>

<h2><strong>4. RETENTION AND DELETION</strong></h2>

<p>4.1. You may only retain Epic Account Data for as long as necessary for the Permitted Uses or as required by applicable law.</p>

<p>4.2. You agree to promptly and securely delete all of a User’s Epic Account Data upon the User’s request, and provide an easily accessible mechanism for Users to make that request.</p>

<p>4.3. You agree to promptly and securely delete all of a User’s Epic Account Data upon notification from Epic that the User has submitted a deletion request to Epic.</p>

<p>4.4. Promptly upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Addendum or the Agreement, you shall promptly and securely delete all Epic Account Data in your possession, custody, or control.</p>

<p>4.5. In the event and during the period that you are unable to perform any such deletion for reasons permitted under applicable law, you agree to (i) promptly inform Epic of the reason(s) for your refusal of the deletion; (ii) ensure the privacy, security, confidentiality, and integrity of the Epic Account Data in accordance with this Addendum and the Agreement; (iii) immediately cease from using the Epic Account Data except as required by applicable law; and (iv) delete the Epic Account Data promptly after the reason(s) for your refusal has expired.</p>

<h2><strong>5. SECURITY MEASURES</strong></h2>

<p>5.1. You agree to develop, implement, and maintain technical and organizational security measures that are appropriate to protect Epic Account Data from unauthorized or accidental Processing. These must include, without limitation, a comprehensive software security program and secure software development safeguards to control for internal and external risks to the privacy, security, confidentiality, and integrity of Epic Account Data.</p>

<p>5.2. You will ensure that only authorized personnel and representatives are granted access to Epic Account Data, and only on a need-to-know basis, and that they only Process Epic Account Data in accordance with the terms of this Addendum and the Agreement. To the extent you engage service providers to Process Epic Account Data, you must ensure that the service providers are bound to a contract that imposes obligations that are substantially the same as, and no less protective than, those contained in this Addendum. You acknowledge and agree that you will remain fully liable for the performance of your service providers’ obligations.</p>

<p>5.3. You agree to immediately inform Epic through the Developer Portal upon becoming aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized or accidental Processing of Epic Account Data (“Epic Account Data Incident”). You agree to promptly investigate such Epic Account Data Incident, take all necessary and advisable corrective actions, and cooperate fully with Epic in all reasonable and lawful efforts to prevent, mitigate, or rectify the Epic Account Data Incident. You will provide Epic with such assurances as Epic may request that such Epic Account Data Incident is not likely to recur.</p>

<h2><strong>6. COMPLIANCE MONITORING</strong></h2>

<p>6.1. You agree to make available to Epic all information and materials necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Addendum and the Agreement, and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Epic (or a designee acting on behalf of Epic) of your Video Games, applications, systems, and records, relating in any way to your obligations as set forth in this Addendum and the Agreement. Any inspection performed pursuant to this Addendum will take place at a mutually agreed upon time during your normal business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal conduct of your business or cause you to violate your confidentiality obligations. You will reasonably cooperate with any such inspection initiated by Epic.</p>

<p>6.2. You acknowledge and agree that Epic will have the right to monitor your use of the Service and your compliance with this Addendum and the Agreement. You must not interfere or attempt to interfere with such monitoring.</p>

<p>6.3. Once per calendar year Epic will notify you that you are required to certify your continued compliance with the terms of this Addendum in the Developer Portal. Failure to self-certify your compliance within three months after notification may result in Epic revoking your access to the Service and Epic Account Data, and/or requiring you to promptly delete Epic Account Data then in your possession, custody, or control.</p>

<h2><strong>7. EU DATA TRANSFERS</strong></h2>

<p>7.1. In the event that you access Epic Account Data to which the EU General Data Protection Regulation applies from a location that has not been the subject of an adequacy determination by the European Commission:</p>

<p>7.1.1. Controller-to-Controller Standard Contractual Clauses will apply and are incorporated here by reference. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Addendum and the provisions of the Controller-to-Controller Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail.</p>

<p>7.1.2. For the purposes of the Controller-to-Controller Standard Contractual Clauses, Epic is the data exporter and you are the data importer.

<h2><strong>8. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</strong></h2>

<p>8.1. You agree and acknowledge that any Processing of Epic Account Data in violation of this Addendum, the Agreement, or any Privacy Law may cause immediate and irreparable harm to Epic for which money damages may not constitute an adequate remedy. Therefore, you agree that Epic may obtain specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to its remedies at law. Epic shall be entitled to such equitable relief in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.</p>

<h2><strong>9. SURVIVAL</strong></h2>

<p>9.1.&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, you acknowledge and agree that your obligations set forth in this Addendum will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement until Epic Account Data is no longer in your possession, custody, or control.</p>

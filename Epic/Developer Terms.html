&nbsp;</h1>

<h1><strong>EPIC ONLINE SERVICES DEVELOPER AGREEMENT</strong></h1>

<p>LAST UPDATED 18TH OF MARCH 2021</p>

<p>Epic has developed a set of online services for you to use in your Video Games. Epic intends to provide these services to you for use in your Video Games in the same manner and at the same level of quality as Epic expects for Epic’s own Video Games.</p>

<p>Epic offers two tiers of services: Live Services and Preview Services. Live Services are Services that Epic intends to offer on a long-term basis. Preview Services are early preview releases which are expected to change as Epic continues development and for which Epic is soliciting your feedback. All services are Live Services unless otherwise specified in the relevant Service Addendum.</p>

<p>Please read this Agreement carefully. It is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations related to your use of the SDK and related Services. You may only use these services if you comply with the terms of this Agreement. By clicking “Accept,” downloading or using the SDK, or accessing the Services, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not download or use the SDK or access any Services.</p>

<p>Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement. Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 12.</p>

<p>If your primary residence (or primary place of business, if you are a legal entity like a corporation or an academic institution) is in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games, Inc. If it is not in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games International S.à r.l., acting through its Swiss branch.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>1. PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT</strong></strong></h2>

<p>The purpose of this Agreement is to establish terms regarding your use of the SDK and related Services. Accepting this Agreement enables you to access the Services listed in the Service Addendum for Standard Services below. You may access additional Services by accepting the applicable Service Addenda, which may include Service or feature-specific terms. This Agreement together with any Service Addenda and any documentation incorporated by reference constitute one single agreement.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>2. SERVICES</strong></strong></h2>

<p>2.1. During the term of this Agreement, Epic will make available the Services and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Services in substantially the same manner and level of quality that Epic provides with respect to services for its own games, taking into consideration whether such Services are Preview Services or Live Services.</p>

<p>2.2. Epic’s obligations under Section 2.1 are conditioned upon (a) your ongoing, good-faith cooperation to perform all tasks necessary, or reasonably requested by Epic, to integrate the SDK and ensure that your Video Games are compatible with the SDK and Services, and (b) your compliance with all applicable terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>2.3. If you do not use or access a particular Service for a period of one year or longer, upon thirty (30) days’ notice Epic may delete any data relating to such Service that is stored or maintained through the Service.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>3. LICENSE GRANT</strong></strong></h2>

<p>3.1. During the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and subject to your compliance with such terms and conditions, Epic hereby grants you a non-sublicensable, terminable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license only to: (a) use the Epic Materials internally to evaluate the Services for use in connection with your Video Games; (b) use the Epic Materials to integrate the Services in applications related to your Video Games, including by incorporating Distributable Code in your Video Games; and (c) distribute the Distributable Code, incorporated in object code format only as an inseparable part of your Video Games, to end users who are subject to an end user license agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Epic Materials.</p>

<p>3.2. All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by the terms of this Agreement. No license or other rights will be created hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.</p>

<p>3.3. Accounts and Credentials</p>

<p>3.3.1. In order to download the SDK or access the Developer Portal, you must set up an Account. You may not share or allow others to use your Account. You are responsible for the security of your Account. Use of your Account, including in the Developer Portal, is subject to Epic’s terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

<p>3.3.2. In order to use the Services, Epic may provide you with Credentials. You may only share Credentials with Licensed EOS Developers to utilize the Credentials in good faith to use the Services in connection with your Video Game. You agree not to share your Credentials with any third party except as permitted above.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>4. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS AND ACCEPTABLE USE</strong></strong></h2>

<p>4.1. You agree not to, and you will not permit any third party to:</p>

<p>(a) access the Services or Epic Materials except through the SDK, the Developer Portal, or as otherwise expressly authorized by Epic;</p>

<p>(b) use the SDK with any applications or software other than in connection with your Video Games;</p>

<p>(c) combine, distribute, or otherwise use the SDK with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the SDK be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement; or</p>

<p>(d) utilize Epic Materials or the Services:</p>

<p>(1) in any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation;</p>

<p>(2) to interfere with any third party’s access to any of the Epic Materials or the Services, intentionally or otherwise;</p>

<p>(3) to tamper with or circumvent technical restrictions on use, access, storage, or any function of the Services or Epic Materials, for example by using access Credentials you are not authorized to use; or</p>

<p>(4) in an unreasonable or excessive manner given the scope, nature, and content of your Video Game, for example to conduct a DDOS attack on the Services.</p>

<p>4.2. Epic reserves the right to immediately remove content stored or maintained through the Services or disable access to, suspend, or terminate the Services to comply with applicable law or if you are in violation of this Section 4 or any Service Addendum. You agree to provide information or other materials related to your use of the Services as reasonably requested by Epic to investigate the source of any problem with the Services or to verify your compliance with this Agreement.</p>

<p>4.3. Epic intends to be transparent in its management and enforcement of the restrictions above. Epic will keep you up-to-date and provide additional guidance on these issues through the Epic Online Services Acceptable Use Policy. In addition, technical documentation outlining how to use the SDK and the Services, including any technical restrictions on their use, is available on Epic’s documentation page.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>5. UPDATES AND AMENDMENTS</strong></strong></h2>

<p>5.1. Epic may release SDK Updates from time to time and make them available via the Developer Portal. Epic will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure each SDK Update is binary compatible with Video Games that integrate the prior version of the SDK. You will be expected to update your Video Games to use the SDK Update within three (3) years of its release. Beyond this time period, Epic intends to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure continued backward compatibility of any Live Services, but Epic does not have any obligation to support any prior version for more than three (3) years from the time it has received an SDK Update.</p>

<p>5.2. Epic may discontinue support for any Live Service upon three (3) years’ written notice to you.</p>

<p>5.3. Epic may introduce breaking changes to any Preview Service at any time upon prior written notice to you.</p>

<p>5.4. Epic may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion by providing notice to you or by providing you with digital access to the amended Agreement when you log in to the Developer Portal or download SDK Updates. You are not required to accept the amended Agreement. However, in order to use new SDK Updates or access new Services that Epic offers, you must accept the amended Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Epic may amend this Agreement with respect to the current version of the SDK or the current Services to comply with law or regulatory requirements, in which case Epic will provide reasonable notice to you.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong></strong></h2>

<p>6.1. Epic and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest including all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Epic Trademarks, Epic Materials, and the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, all Intellectual Property Rights in the Distributable Code as integrated in your Video Game(s) shall remain the property of Epic. Epic retains all right, title, and interest in Epic-Owned Data. You must take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect all applications or systems that make use of Epic-Owned Data against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure. Please review each Service Addendum carefully for additional requirements relating to your use of Epic-Owned Data.</p>

<p>6.2. As between you and Epic, you (and your licensors, if any) retain all right, title, and interest including all Intellectual Property Rights in and to your Video Game(s) (excluding any Distributable Code and Epic Materials integrated therein) and Your Data. You grant Epic a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide license to use and reproduce Your Data solely for the purpose of providing the Services. Epic takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect all applications or systems that make use of Your Data against unauthorized or unlawful access, use destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure.</p>

<p>6.3. Proprietary Notices; Trademarks</p>

<p>6.3.1. You agree not to remove or destroy any copyright notices, trademarks, or other proprietary or confidential legends or markings placed upon or contained within or on any of the Epic Materials, including but not limited to on any documentation or materials related to the SDK.</p>

<p>6.3.2. You acknowledge and agree that you have no rights with respect to any trademarks, service marks, trade names, or logos of Epic or its Affiliates (the “Epic Trademarks”). If you wish to make use of Epic Trademarks, please go to <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/branding" target="_blank">dev.epicgames.com/branding</a>.</p>

<p>6.3.3. The Services include features that allow you to post, submit, publish, display, or transmit to Epic and other Users your trademarks, service marks, trade names, or logos (“Your Marks”). You agree to grant and hereby grant to Epic a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and use Your Marks, solely as uploaded by you and solely for the purpose of providing the Services.</p>

<p>6.4. As used herein, “Feedback” means suggestions, comments, ideas, and all other types of information, including software and code, which (a) you give or communicate directly or indirectly (including your employees, agents, contractors, or representatives) to Epic or its agents; and (b) relates to the SDK, its components, any Services, or the Developer Portal. You agree to grant and hereby grant to Epic a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, non-terminable, transferable, and assignable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, modify, and create derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit any and all Feedback for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. Any and all Feedback shall be subject to Epic’s underlying rights in the subject matter of such Feedback. You understand and agree that Epic is not required to make any use of any Feedback that you provide. You agree that if Epic makes use of your Feedback, Epic is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution. You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback that you provide to Epic to grant Epic and other affected parties the rights described above. This includes but is not limited to Intellectual Property Rights and other proprietary or personal rights.</p>

<p>6.5. The SDK includes third-party software components (“Third-Party Software”). If Third-Party Software has separate software license or attribution requirements, the license terms or other attribution requirements for Third-Party Software components will be provided in the ThirdPartyNotices folder of the SDK.</p>

<p>6.6. Epic collects quality of service metrics relating to your use of the Services and SDK ("Quality of Service Metrics") and uses Quality of Service Metrics only for the purpose of providing the Services. Quality of Service Metrics exclusively include telemetry data derived from API requests and additional data collected by the SDK. The Quality of Service Metrics collected by the SDK include a randomly-generated session identifier for each session making API calls, the number of API calls, latency, and HTTP and internal status codes (i.e., success and error codes).</p>

<h2><strong><strong>7. NOTICES</strong></strong></h2>

<p>Where this Agreement calls for notice from Epic, including written notice, Epic may provide notice to you at the email address that you use to register for or access the Services or at the relevant email address you may have configured for notices on the Developer Portal. Epic’s notices to you will be effective when they are sent to that email address.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>8. DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></strong></h2>

<p>8.1. The Epic Materials and Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind. Epic, its licensors, and its and their Affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Epic Materials and Services, including all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of that purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, currency, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Epic, its licensors, and its and their Affiliates make no warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials and Services will operate properly, (2) the Epic Materials and Services will meet your requirements, (3) the operation of the Epic Materials and Services will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, (4) any defects in the Epic Materials and Services can or will be corrected, (5) the Epic Materials and Services are or will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or (6) a platform manufacturer will approve any of your Video Games, or will not revoke approval of any Video Game for any or no reason. Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed. Epic, its licensors, and its and their Affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Epic Materials and Services.

<h2><strong>2. PERMITTED USE</strong></h2>

<p>2.1. You agree to only use the Service and/or Process Epic Account Data for the purpose of authenticating Users, providing Epic’s social features in connection with your Video Game(s), and assisting Users in making social connections across other services (collectively, the “Permitted Uses”). Unless required by applicable law, you agree not to use, retain, disclose, or otherwise Process Epic Account Data for any other purpose.</p>

<p>2.2. Epic Account Data is Epic-Owned Data, even when used or exposed with other Services and when created or modified through your Video Game.</p>

<p>2.4. You may not collect data about Epic Accounts directly from Users or from any source other than through the Service. You may not proxy, request, or collect Epic Account access credentials.</p>

<p>2.9. You must obtain explicit consent in your Video Game from a User before importing any of that User’s Epic Account Data for the purpose of making social connections across other services. A disclosure of this use of Epic Account Data in your privacy policy alone is insufficient. Consent to this use of Epic Account Data must not be required as part of your Video Game. You agree to provide a transparent and easily accessible mechanism for Users to withdraw their consent to your use of that User’s Epic Account Data for this purpose.</p>

<p>2.10. You agree not to sell, rent, license, release, disclose, disseminate, transfer, or otherwise make available, in whole or in part, any Epic Account Data to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. Such third parties include, but are not limited to, data brokers, ad networks, ad exchanges, and advertisers.</p>

<h2><strong>3. PRIVACY LAWS</strong></h2>

<p>5.2. You will ensure that only authorized personnel and representatives are granted access to Epic Account Data, and only on a need-to-know basis, and that they only Process Epic Account Data in accordance with the terms of this Addendum and the Agreement. To the extent you engage service providers to Process Epic Account Data, you must ensure that the service providers are bound to a contract that imposes obligations that are substantially the same as, and no less protective than, those contained in this Addendum. You acknowledge and agree that you will remain fully liable for the performance of your service providers’ obligations.</p>

<p>5.3. You agree to immediately inform Epic through the Developer Portal upon becoming aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized or accidental Processing of Epic Account Data (“Epic Account Data Incident”). You agree to promptly investigate such Epic Account Data Incident, take all necessary and advisable corrective actions, and cooperate fully with Epic in all reasonable and lawful efforts to prevent, mitigate, or rectify the Epic Account Data Incident. You will provide Epic with such assurances as Epic may request that such Epic Account Data Incident is not likely to recur.</p>

<h2><strong>6. COMPLIANCE MONITORING</strong></h2>

<p>6.1. You agree to make available to Epic all information and materials necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Addendum and the Agreement, and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by Epic (or a designee acting on behalf of Epic) of your Video Games, applications, systems, and records, relating in any way to your obligations as set forth in this Addendum and the Agreement. Any inspection performed pursuant to this Addendum will take place at a mutually agreed upon time during your normal business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal conduct of your business or cause you to violate your confidentiality obligations. You will reasonably cooperate with any such inspection initiated by Epic.</p>

<p>6.2. You acknowledge and agree that Epic will have the right to monitor your use of the Service and your compliance with this Addendum and the Agreement. You must not interfere or attempt to interfere with such monitoring.</p>

<p>6.3. Once per calendar year Epic will notify you that you are required to certify your continued compliance with the terms of this Addendum in the Developer Portal. Failure to self-certify your compliance within three months after notification may result in Epic revoking your access to the Service and Epic Account Data, and/or requiring you to promptly delete Epic Account Data then in your possession, custody, or control.</p>

<h2><strong>7. EU DATA TRANSFERS</strong></h2>

<p>7.1. In the event that you access Epic Account Data to which the EU General Data Protection Regulation applies from a location that has not been the subject of an adequacy determination by the European Commission:</p>

<p>7.1.1. Controller-to-Controller Standard Contractual Clauses will apply and are incorporated here by reference.

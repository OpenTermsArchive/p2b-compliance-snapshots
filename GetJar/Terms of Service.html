<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>We may update or change these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to these Terms by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us, if any, or by prominently posting a notice of the changes on the GetJar Site. The amended Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) days following our posting of notice of the changes on the GetJar Site. It is your responsibility to regularly check the applicable pages of the GetJar Site to determine if there have been changes to these Terms and to review such changes. If you do not agree to any changes to these Terms, you must cease accessing or using the GetJar Site and any Materials, services, or sites, available on or accessible through the GetJar Site, and if you have an account with GetJar, notify GetJar to terminate your account. Continued use of the GetJar Site or any Materials, services, or sites, available on or accessible through the GetJar Site, after any changes in these Terms will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by these Terms as updated.</p>
<p>We may update or change any additional terms or our Privacy Policy in a similar manner by providing you notice of any material changes by e-mail, if we have your e-mail address in our records, or by prominently posting a notice of the changes on the GetJar Site where the original additional terms or Privacy Policy were made available to you. The amended Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) days following our dispatch of the e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) days following our posting of notice of the changes on the GetJar Site. You will be bound by any such updates or changes to the additional terms or our Privacy Policy in the same manner as you would be bound by any changes to these Terms.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p>These Terms and any additional terms referenced in these Terms, including the Privacy Policy, and the relationship between you and GetJar, will be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A. without giving effect to any principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the GetJar Site or any Materials, services, or sites, available on or accessible through the GetJar Site.</p>
<p>You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within the State of California, U.S.A. for the purpose of litigating all claims or disputes arising from or related to these Terms, or any additional terms referenced in these Terms, including the Privacy Policy. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than ten thousand United States dollars (10,000 USD), the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If a party elects arbitration, that party will initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (3) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any election by you to resolve any dispute through arbitration, we will have the right to seek injunctive and other equitable relief as well as damages from any court having competent jurisdiction to protect ours and any other user's confidential information and intellectual property.</p>
<p>The failure of GetJar to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The term "including" means "including without limitation."</p>
<p>These Terms, which incorporate the GetJar Privacy Policy and all Addendums for GetJar Services you have chosen to participate in, constitutes the entire agreement between you and GetJar and governs your use of the GetJar Services and GetJar Site, superseding any prior agreements (whether written or oral) between you and GetJar regarding the subject matter of these Terms. If any provision in an Addendum conflicts with any provision of these Terms, the provision in the Addendum will control but only to the extent it relates to the subject matter of the Addendum. If any provision in the Privacy Policy conflicts with any provision of these Terms, the provision in the Privacy Policy will control.</p>

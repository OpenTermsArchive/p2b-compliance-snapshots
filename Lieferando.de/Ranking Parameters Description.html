        "text": "<p><strong>Distance:</strong> The most important ranking factor is distance. At Lieferando.de we prioritise restaurants that are closest to the delivery address to spread the orders on our platform as much as possible between the active restaurants. We also want to ensure a customer’s waiting time is short and restaurants only need to travel a few kilometres when delivering their meals. When ‘Pick-up’ is selected instead of ‘Delivery’, we rank all restaurants based on distance in the default listing.  <br><br><strong>Quality:</strong> The quality score is a measurement based on our customers’ average feedback via their most recent food and delivery ratings. This way, it shows a fair image of the delivered quality because Lieferando.de has millions of customers, all with different preferences. Please note that the content or characteristics of a restaurant&#39;s menu or meals will on its own not have an effect on its position on the platform, but could in turn impact the quality score due to better reviews.<br><br><strong>Popularity: </strong>We determine popularity by the number of recent orders processed by a restaurant compared to other restaurants in that area. While this mainly applies to chain restaurants, it could also apply to more prominent restaurants in a city centre. ‘Popular restaurants’ also tend to employ more delivery staff and therefore can typically cover a larger delivery area and more orders. Based on their popularity, we place them somewhat higher on the list than restaurants that do not have this kind of capacity. <br><br><strong>New restaurants:</strong> New restaurants temporarily receive an improved position on Lieferando.de because they have fewer reviews. To help these restaurants get started, they receive a higher placement for a short period of time (usually for a week). We indicate new restaurants with the ‘New’ label. <br><br><strong>Logistic efficiency: </strong>Lieferando.de may temporarily move restaurants down the list if we know that their orders are unlikely to be delivered to customers within a reasonable timeframe due to capacity issues at the restaurant or our delivery services. In addition, both Lieferando.de and the restaurant can decide to &quot;close&quot; a restaurant on the platform if it is too busy in which case it will no longer appear in the restaurant list. For chains with multiple restaurants that deliver to a customer&#39;s location we show the closest open branch first and move the further away chains down the list.<br><br><strong>Sponsored Results: </strong>Lieferando.de offers a paid sponsorship service, allowing restaurants to improve their visibility on the platform by moving up their rank in the ’Best match’ search results. This improved visibility is in proportion to the ranking they would otherwise have on Lieferando.de based on the ranking factors listed above. <br><br>For example, a quality 4-star restaurant could appear below a 3-star if the customer is further away, so that restaurant may wish to boost its visibility. It is also possible that a restaurant may want more orders on a certain day of the week, and uses the sponsorship services to increase orders for that day.<br><br>While our sponsorship services are important tools for restaurants, relevance to customers continues to be one of the main aims behind our ranking. To ensure that the results remain relevant to customers, restaurants have limitations on improving their visibility. For example, it will be too costly for restaurant #150 in an outer suburb to use our sponsored service and obtain the number 1 position for the entire city. <br><br>We also restrict the number of spots a restaurant can move up the list to ensure that even when restaurants are using our sponsored services, customers feedback will always directly influence their position in the restaurant list. We want to reward restaurants that provide excellent service to customers while offering customers the best food-ordering experience possible. </p><p><br><strong>Favourites:</strong> Customers have the possibility to save restaurants as a ‘Favourite’. These restaurants will appear higher up in the restaurant list in order for customers to find them more easily. <br><br><strong>Other factors: </strong>Furthermore, if any filtering, sorting, or searching actions have been taken, this will affect the order and types of restaurants shown based on the eligibility of those restaurants to the filtering, sorting, or searching criteria.<br><br><strong>Testing: </strong>From time to time, we may run tests or experiments to monitor and improve our service, which may temporarily impact the restaurant order. </p>"

        "text": "<p>Lieferando.de provides an online food ordering and delivery platform that lists more than 15.000 professional third party restaurants across Deutschland, where consumers can place their orders. We ask restaurants listing on our platform to provide us with their company information, and this enables us to make a declaration that they are a professional trader (and not a consumer) to the best of our knowledge. If you are in Deutschland, you will find this declaration within the &quot;info&quot; section of each restaurant&#39;s page.</p><p>Via the platform, Lieferando.de acts as a technical intermediary allowing restaurants to provide products (such as meals) for delivery and/or takeaway. The contract for the supply and purchase of the products is between consumers and the restaurant from which an order is placed. In some cases, Lieferando.de is also responsible for the delivery.</p>"

        "text": "<p>The order of restaurants in the restaurant list of Lieferando.de is dynamic and subject to a wide variety of factors. Our aim is to show our customers restaurants that they are likely to order from, in a fair way for our restaurant partners, whilst optimising for a great ordering experience. <br><br>The default order we list our restaurants is what we refer to as the ‘Best match’. The main factors used to determine the Best match order are distance to the customer and the ‘Quality score’, which is based on reviews. Popularity factors, such as the number of orders a restaurant receives, also play a role in the organisation of the list. Temporary factors such as the weather or busy times could impact the order too. Finally, to increase visibility, restaurants have the ability to sponsor their listing to appear higher in the restaurant list. Restaurants that make use of this are displayed on the Platform as ‘sponsored’. You can find more information on the ranking parameters here: What are the main ranking parameters?<br><br>As all factors may be subject to change, the order of restaurants in the restaurant list is dynamic. Your neighbour may see a different order than you do, and you could also see differences between your list at 17:00 and at 21:00. <br><br>Finally, you can always use filters to make the selection more specific or use the sorting options that are available. We aim to always display the most relevant list for you, but after all, tastes differ!</p>"

data-qa="article-content-description" style="color: var(--xds-color-content-subdued);"><p><strong>Distance:</strong> The most important ranking factor is distance. At Lieferando.de we prioritise restaurants that are closest to the delivery address to spread the orders on our platform as much as possible between the active restaurants. We also want to ensure a customer’s waiting time is short and restaurants only need to travel a few kilometres when delivering their meals. When ‘Pick-up’ is selected instead of ‘Delivery’, we rank all restaurants based on distance in the default listing.  <br><br><strong>Quality:</strong>&nbsp;The quality score is a measurement based on our customers’ average feedback via their most recent food and delivery ratings. This way, it shows a fair image of the delivered quality because Lieferando.de has millions of customers, all with different preferences. Please note that the content or characteristics of a restaurant's menu or meals will on its own not have an effect on its position on the platform, but could in turn impact the quality score due to better reviews.<br><br><strong>Popularity: </strong>We determine popularity by the number of recent orders processed by a restaurant compared to other restaurants in that area. While this mainly applies to chain restaurants, it could also apply to more prominent restaurants in a city centre. ‘Popular restaurants’ also tend to employ more delivery staff and therefore can typically cover a larger delivery area and more orders. Based on their popularity, we place them somewhat higher on the list than restaurants that do not have this kind of capacity. <br><br><strong>New restaurants:</strong> New restaurants temporarily receive an improved position on Lieferando.de because they have fewer reviews. To help these restaurants get started, they receive a higher placement for a short period of time (usually for a week). We indicate new restaurants with the ‘New’ label. <br><br><strong>Logistic efficiency: </strong>Lieferando.de may temporarily move restaurants down the list if we know that their orders are unlikely to be delivered to customers within a reasonable timeframe due to capacity issues at the restaurant or our delivery services. In addition, both Lieferando.de and the restaurant can decide to "close" a restaurant on the platform if it is too busy in which case it will no longer appear in the restaurant list. For chains with multiple restaurants that deliver to a customer's location we show the closest open branch first and move the further away chains down the list.<br><br><strong>Sponsored Results: </strong>Lieferando.de offers a paid sponsorship service, allowing restaurants to improve their visibility on the platform by moving up their rank in the ’Best match’ search results. This improved visibility is in proportion to the ranking they would otherwise have on Lieferando.de based on the ranking factors listed above. <br><br>For example, a quality 4-star restaurant could appear below a 3-star if the customer is further away, so that restaurant may wish to boost its visibility. It is also possible that a restaurant may want more orders on a certain day of the week, and uses the sponsorship services to increase orders for that day.<br><br>While our sponsorship services are important tools for restaurants, relevance to customers continues to be one of the main aims behind our ranking. To ensure that the results remain relevant to customers, restaurants have limitations on improving their visibility. For example, it will be too costly for restaurant #150 in an outer suburb to use our sponsored service and obtain the number 1 position for the entire city. <br><br>We also restrict the number of spots a restaurant can move up the list to ensure that even when restaurants are using our sponsored services, customers feedback will always directly influence their position in the restaurant list. We want to reward restaurants that provide excellent service to customers while offering customers the best food-ordering experience possible. </p><p><br><strong>Favourites:</strong> Customers have the possibility to save restaurants as a ‘Favourite’. These restaurants will appear higher up in the restaurant list in order for customers to find them more easily. <br><br><strong>Other factors:&nbsp;</strong>Furthermore, if any filtering, sorting, or searching actions have been taken, this will affect the order and types of restaurants shown based on the eligibility of those restaurants to the filtering, sorting, or searching criteria.<br><br><strong>Testing:&nbsp;</strong>From time to time, we may run tests or experiments to monitor and improve our service, which may temporarily impact the restaurant order.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><div data-qa="util"><div role="separator" class="_3DzJ2" aria-hidden="true" data-qa="divider"><div data-qa="util" style="margin-bottom: var(--xds-spacing-e);"><div class="_1aJMN"><hr class="_3oPhm _122wD"></div></div></div><div><div class="_1sMed _1wlHd _2cDMI _2_u6_" data-qa="article-content-vote-section"><div data-qa="flex-item"><b class="_3CT81 _2PIGg" data-qa="text" style="color: var(--xds-color-content-default);">Was this article helpful?</b></div><div class="_1sMed _2JYYu _2cDMI" data-qa="article-content-vote-section-un-voted"><div data-qa="flex-item"><div class="_1sMed _1wlHd _2cDMI" data-qa="flex"><div data-qa="util" style="margin-right: var(--xds-spacing-d);"><span class="_3I0XC _3-HpP _3N1fC" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-live="polite" aria-busy="false" aria-atomic="true" aria-disabled="false" data-qa="article-content-vote-section-un-voted-up-vote-button"><span class="_21Vy- Jhc8N VrfUP" data-qa="icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="1em" height="1em" role="presentation" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M14.072 7.878a1.512 1.512 0 00-.962-.753l-1.96-.481.49-2.415a1.75 1.75 0 00-.376-1.479 1.75 1.75 0 00-1.374-.656H8.875L6.372 7.239a.21.21 0 01-.183.105H1.875v1.312h2.739a12.513 12.513 0 00-.21 2.328 9.083 9.083 0 00.096 1.61H1.875v1.312h9.065a2.406 2.406 0 002.24-1.531l1.024-3.272a1.558 1.558 0 00-.132-1.225zm-1.12.822l-1.006 3.22a1.076 1.076 0 01-1.006.674H5.856a8.05 8.05 0 01-.14-1.61 10.99 10.99 0 01.236-2.328h.237a1.575 1.575 0 001.338-.787L9.75 3.406h.175a.473.473 0 01.455.56l-.761 3.64 3.176.814a.236.236 0 01.14.105.218.218 0 01.018.175z"></path></svg></span></span></div><span class="_3I0XC _3-HpP _3N1fC" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-live="polite" aria-busy="false" aria-atomic="true" aria-disabled="false" data-qa="article-content-vote-section-un-voted-down-vote-button"><span class="_21Vy- Jhc8N VrfUP" data-qa="icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="1em" height="1em" role="presentation" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M14.204 6.906L13.18 3.625a2.406 2.406 0 00-2.24-1.54H1.875v1.312H4.5a9.082 9.082 0 00-.131 1.61c-.003.781.067 1.56.21 2.328H1.875v1.312h4.314a.21.21 0 01.183.105l2.503 5.154h.989a1.793 1.793 0 001.75-2.135l-.464-2.415 1.96-.481a1.514 1.514 0 00.963-.726 1.557 1.557 0 00.13-1.243zm-1.269.569a.236.236 0 01-.14.105l-3.176.814.726 3.64a.473.473 0 01-.455.56h-.14L7.562 8.13a1.575 1.575 0 00-1.338-.787h-.272a10.99 10.99 0 01-.236-2.328 8.05 8.05 0 01.14-1.61h5.084a1.076 1.076 0 011.006.674l1.007 3.22a.218.218 0 01-.018.175z"></path></svg></span></span></div></div></div></div></div><div role="separator" class="_3DzJ2" aria-hidden="true" data-qa="divider"><div data-qa="util" style="margin-top: var(--xds-spacing-e);"><div class="_1aJMN"><hr class="_3oPhm _122wD"></div></div></div></div><div data-qa="util" style="margin-top: var(--xds-spacing-i);"><h2 class="_50YZr _11kfx" data-qa="article-content-related-articles-heading" style="color: var(--xds-color-content-default);">Related articles</h2></div><div data-qa="util" style="margin-top: var(--xds-spacing-d);"><div data-qa="article-content-related-articles"><div data-qa="article-content-related-articles-item" class="_12LbDQ"><h5 class="_50YZr _3hlni" data-qa="heading" style="color: var(--xds-color-content-default);">What is the status of restaurants listed on Lieferando.de?</h5><div data-qa="util" style="margin-top: var(--xds-spacing-b);"><div class="_2GljJ _3EHTe _2PIGg" data-qa="text" style="color: var(--xds-color-content-subdued);">Lieferando.de provides an online food ordering and delivery platform that lists more than 15.000 professional third party restaurants across Deutschland, where consumers can place ...</div></div><div class="_1fr0VS"><a class="_3VpRA _1oYzK _3oPEi" href="/en/customerservice/article/what-is-the-status-of-restaurants-listed" tabindex="0" data-qa="article-content-related-articles-item-read-more-link"><div class="_2GljJ" data-qa="text">Read more</div></a></div><div role="separator" class="_3DzJ2" aria-hidden="true" data-qa="divider"><div data-qa="util" style="margin-top: var(--space-n);

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. \\n It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\r\n{br}\r\nWhy do we use it?\r\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\r\n\r\n","consumerWebCommon.metric.distance.km":"{distance} km","consumerWebCommon.metric.distance.m":"{distance} m","consumerWebCommon.accountModal.takeawayPayOverview.additionalRestrictionsDetails":"Additional company restrictions may apply.","consumerWebCommon.accountModal.takeawayPayOverview.contactAdminForHelp":"If you have any questions regarding your Takeaway Pay balance, please contact the Takeaway Pay admin of your company.","consumerWebCommon.accountModal.takeawayPayOverview.unavailable":"Unavailable","consumerWebCommon.accountModal.takeawayPayOverview.Limitation_YourMonthlyBalanceLowerThanDailyBalance":"You can only use your monthly balance as it is lower than your daily allowance.","consumerWebCommon.accountModal.takeawayPayOverview.Limitation_AllowanceIsUnavaliableDueToSetTimeOrLocationLimits":"Your allowance is currently unavailable due to the date and time restrictions set by your admin.","consumerWebCommon.accountModal.takeawayPayOverview.Limitation_UnknownError":"Something went wrong.

At Lieferando.de we prioritise restaurants that are closest to the delivery address to spread the orders on our platform as much as possible between the active restaurants. We also want to ensure a customer’s waiting time is short and restaurants only need to travel a few kilometres when delivering their meals. When ‘Pick-up’ is selected instead of ‘Delivery’, we rank all restaurants based on distance in the default listing.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuality:\u003c/strong\u003e The quality score is a measurement based on our customers’ average feedback via their most recent food and delivery ratings. This way, it shows a fair image of the delivered quality because Lieferando.de has millions of customers, all with different preferences. Please note that the content or characteristics of a restaurant\u0026#39;s menu or meals will on its own not have an effect on its position on the platform, but could in turn impact the quality score due to better reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePopularity: \u003c/strong\u003eWe determine popularity by the number of recent orders processed by a restaurant compared to other restaurants in that area. While this mainly applies to chain restaurants, it could also apply to more prominent restaurants in a city centre. ‘Popular restaurants’ also tend to employ more delivery staff and therefore can typically cover a larger delivery area and more orders. Based on their popularity, we place them somewhat higher on the list than restaurants that do not have this kind of capacity. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew restaurants:\u003c/strong\u003e New restaurants temporarily receive an improved position on Lieferando.de because they have fewer reviews. To help these restaurants get started, they receive a higher placement for a short period of time (usually for a week). We indicate new restaurants with the ‘New’ label. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLogistic efficiency: \u003c/strong\u003eLieferando.de may temporarily move restaurants down the list if we know that their orders are unlikely to be delivered to customers within a reasonable timeframe due to capacity issues at the restaurant or our delivery services. In addition, both Lieferando.de and the restaurant can decide to \u0026quot;close\u0026quot; a restaurant on the platform if it is too busy in which case it will no longer appear in the restaurant list.

This improved visibility is in proportion to the ranking they would otherwise have on Lieferando.de based on the ranking factors listed above. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, a quality 4-star restaurant could appear below a 3-star if the customer is further away, so that restaurant may wish to boost its visibility. It is also possible that a restaurant may want more orders on a certain day of the week, and uses the sponsorship services to increase orders for that day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile our sponsorship services are important tools for restaurants, relevance to customers continues to be one of the main aims behind our ranking. To ensure that the results remain relevant to customers, restaurants have limitations on improving their visibility. For example, it will be too costly for restaurant #150 in an outer suburb to use our sponsored service and obtain the number 1 position for the entire city. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also restrict the number of spots a restaurant can move up the list to ensure that even when restaurants are using our sponsored services, customers feedback will always directly influence their position in the restaurant list.

If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days of the date that you or Snap send your Pre-Arbitration Demand, arbitration may then be filed.

The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.

Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</b></h2><p>THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS SECTION APPLIES IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH SNAP INC. (IF YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH ANY OTHER SNAP ENTITY, SEE THE <a href="/en-US/terms/#arbitration-row"><u>Arbitration</u></a>&nbsp;provision of the&nbsp;<a href="/en-US/terms/#terms-row"><u>Snap Group Limited Terms of Service</u></a>.)</p><p>a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 7 (the “Arbitration Agreement”), You and Snap agree that: (i) the <a href="/en-US/terms/#arbitration">Arbitration</a>&nbsp;provisions of the&nbsp;<a href="/en-US/terms">Snap Inc. Terms of Service</a> do not apply to your use of the Business Services, and (ii) instead, all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Business Services Terms or the use of the Business Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis as set out in this Section 7, except that you and Snap are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</p><p>b. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law. Arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) (https://www.adrservices.com/). If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, and if they cannot agree, will ask the court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>c. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p><p>d. Fees. ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/.&nbsp;</p><p>e. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap.</p><p>f. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Snap are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p><p>g. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 7.</p><p>h. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>i. Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Snap in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: <span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>, Attn: Arbitration Opt-out, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out @ snap.com.</p><p>j. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p><p>k. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snap.</p><p></p></div></div><div id="limitation-of-liability" class="SectionDiv-sc-1vqdap3 jZjsOy"><div class="RichTextBodyContainer-sc-1mnh17e jYNWGT"><h2>8.

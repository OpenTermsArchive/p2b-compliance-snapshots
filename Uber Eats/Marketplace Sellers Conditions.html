Until the moment that Uber Payments has received such updated data or information, Uber Payments may assume that the data and information provided to Uber Payments or the party designated by it are complete and correct.<br> 								<br>4.4  Subject to all applicable laws, Uber Payments may provide to a third party, such as a court of law, a regulatory body or law enforcement, any information (including personal data) about Partners collected and processed for the purpose of providing the Payment Services if: (a) there is a complaint, dispute or conflict between a Partner and a User regarding a payment; (b) it is necessary to enforce the Payments Terms, (c) it is required, in Uber Payments', Uber’s, or any Affiliate’s sole discretion, by applicable law or regulation; (d) it is necessary, in Uber Payments', Uber’s or any Affiliate’s sole discretion, to (1) protect the safety, rights, property or security of Uber Payments, Uber, the Payments Services or any third party, (2) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, and/or (3) prevent or stop activity which Uber Payments, Uber or any of its Affiliates, in their sole discretion, consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable; or (e) it is required or necessary, in Uber Payments', Uber’s or any Affiliate’s sole discretion, for insurance or other purposes related to the Partner’s ability to qualify, or remain qualified, to use the Uber Services. The Partner understands that Uber Payments may retain Partner's personal data for legal, regulatory, safety, and other necessary purposes after the Agreement is terminated. Uber Payments processes personal data in accordance with the Uber privacy policy at https://privacy.uber.com/policy .<br>	<br>4.5  When entering into the Payments Terms, Uber and Uber Payments will ask for the Partner’s consent in accordance with Article 94 PSD 2 to access, process and retain personal data necessary for the provision of the Payment Services. The Partner can revoke the consent given in accordance with this clause at any time. If the Partner revokes the consent, the Partner will not be able to use any Uber Services and Uber will have to terminate the&nbsp;Agreement.</p><p><strong>5. Payment services provided by Uber Payments on behalf of&nbsp;Uber</strong></p><p>5.1 Uber Payments enables the Partner to receive payments from the User or another Partner for Services that the Partner provides through an Uber Platform. The Partner therefore agrees that Uber Payments will accept and process payment transactions, including E-money transactions. More specifically, Uber Payments receives any funds due by the User or another Partner (the Partner Charges) or Uber (the Uber Amounts) on behalf of the Partner. Upon receiving the funds, Uber Payments deducts any applicable Fees and pays out the remainder to the Partner (the Pay-out Amount) as set-out in Article&nbsp;7.</p><p>5.2 Uber Payments administers the Pay-out Amount in the name of the Partner. Uber Payments will only transfer the Pay-out Amount to a Partner (Pay-out) if it has received the full amount (including Fees) from a User or another Partner or another payment service provider (and in the event of an Uber Amount, from Uber) for the Services and if such transfer is in accordance with the Agreement and the Payments&nbsp;Terms.</p><p><strong>6. Partner Charges and P2P&nbsp;Charges</strong></p><p><br>6.1  On behalf of Uber, Uber Payments will collect the Partner Charges due to the Partner for the Services provided. Any such Partner Charges will be received by the Custodian or, if received by Uber Payments, be transferred to the Custodian as soon as possible. Uber Payments will on behalf of Uber subsequently arrange for Pay-out of the Pay-out Amount to the Partner in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.<br>		<br>6.2  Uber Payments will transfer the P2P Charge for the provided Services on behalf of the Partner that owes the P2P Charge to the Partner to which the P2P Charge is due (for which latter Partner Uber Payments receives the P2P Charge as a Partner Charge). Any such transfer of the P2P Charge will be administered by the Custodian.<br>	<br>6.3  Uber Payments will transfer the Pay-out Amount to the Partner in the currency in which the Partner Charge was received by the Custodian.<br>	<br>6.4  Uber Payments will arrange for Pay-out to the bank account as designated by the Partner on the relevant Uber Platform. The Partner may only designate a bank account that is administered in its own name for Pay-out. Any changes of the bank account must be notified to Uber Payments as soon as possible. The Partner represents and warrants that the bank account designated by it on the Uber Platform is a bank account administered in its own name.<br> 		<br>6.5  The Partner authorizes Uber Payments to use the Partner Charges (including for the avoidance of doubt, the P2P Charge) to satisfy all claims of Uber or third parties vis-à-vis the Partner under or pursuant to the Agreement and/or the Payments Terms. Uber Payments is authorized to deduct the amount of such claims from the Partner Charges and transfer such amounts to Uber and itself. Uber Payments shall in this respect be entitled to solely rely on the information it receives from Uber as binding evidence of such amounts due by the Partner. The Partner may provide evidence to the&nbsp;contrary.</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;Pay-out</strong></p><p>7.1  Uber, Uber Payments and the Partner can agree that Pay-out takes place on a specific incidental or recurring date. Such agreement constitutes an instruction for Pay-out. Such instruction for Pay-out will be regarded as having been received by Uber Payments on the moment that the Partner indicates on the relevant Uber Platform that it wishes to receive Pay-out and the agreement to that instruction has been confirmed by Uber on its behalf and on behalf of Uber Payments.<br>			<br>7.2  Any instruction for Pay-out received by (or on behalf of) Uber Payments (a) on a day that is not a Business Day or (b) after 17:00 Amsterdam time on a Business Day will be regarded as having been received on the next Business Day.<br>		<br>7.3  If Pay-out takes place in euros, Uber Payments will ensure that the account of the bank holding such account is credited with the Pay-out amount no later than on the end of the first Business Day immediately following the receipt of the instruction for Pay-out in accordance with these Payments Terms.<br>		<br>7.4  If Pay-out takes place in a currency of an EEA country, but other than euros, Uber Payments will ensure that the account of the bank holding such account is credited with the Pay-out amount no later than the end of the fourth Business Day following the receipt of the instruction for Pay-out in accordance with these Payments Terms.<br>			<br>7.5  In all circumstances other than as described in Articles 7.3 and 7.4, Uber Payments will ensure that Pay-out takes place within a reasonable term.<br>		<br>7.6  Uber Payments will make the Pay-out Amount available for Pay-out to the Partner as soon as the amount has been credited to the Custodian's bank&nbsp;account.</p><p><strong>8. Refusal and limitations on&nbsp;Pay-out</strong></p><p>8.1 Uber Payments may at any time (at its own discretion) decide not to pay-out any Pay-out Amount to a Partner&nbsp;if:</p><ul><li>an attachment has been levied under Uber Payments and/or the Custodian in respect of the&nbsp;Partner;</li><li>Transferring such an amount would conflict with the law or other applicable national or international regulations, relevant guidance or instructions from a competent regulator or a binding judicial order or&nbsp;verdict;</li><li>Uber Payments considers it reasonable and necessary not to the pay-out such amount, for example because that would conflict with its internal policies or applicable&nbsp;procedures;</li><li>The Partner acts in violation of the Agreement or the&nbsp;PaymentsTerms;</li><li>Uber or Uber Payments has a suspicion of fraud by the&nbsp;Partner.</li></ul><p>8.2  For compliance or operational reasons, Uber Payments may limit the amount of each individual Pay-out. If the total amount owed to a Partner is at any time higher than the limit determined by Uber Payments in accordance with the previous sentence, Uber Payments may initiate a series of Pay-outs in one day or on subsequent days.<br>			<br>8.3  If Uber Payments refuses Pay-out, Uber or Uber Payments will notify the Partner as soon as possible of the reasons for this refusal and of the procedure for correcting any factual errors that led to the refusal, and no later than the end of the periods indicated in Articles 7.3 - 7.5, as applicable. Any such notification will be made through the Uber Platforms. Uber and Uber Payments shall not be required to notify the Partner if such notification is prohibited by the laws applicable to it or is prohibited by a competent court or regulator.<br> 		<br>8.4  Uber Payments may limit or temporarily or permanently suspend a Partner's access to the Payment Services (i) to comply with applicable law, or the order or request of a court, law enforcement, a regulator or other administrative agency or governmental body, or if (ii) a Partner has breached the Payments Terms, the Agreement, applicable laws, regulations or third-party rights, (iii) a Partner has provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated, or incomplete information under the Payments Terms or the Agreement, or (iv) Uber Payments believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of Uber, Uber Payments, the Custodian, Users, other Partners, or third parties, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity.<br>		<br>8.5  Partners are responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and tax obligations that may apply to the use of the Payment Services. In connection with the use of the Payment Services, Partners may not and Partners agree that they will not and will not assist or enable others to:	 										<br>a.	breach or circumvent any applicable laws or regulations, agreements with third parties, third-party rights, the Agreement and/or the Payments Terms;								 										<br>b. 	use the Payment Services for any commercial or other purposes that are not expressly permitted by the Agreement and/or the Payments Terms;<br>							<br>c. 	take any action that damages or adversely affects, or could damage or adversely affect, the performance or proper functioning of the Payment&nbsp;Services;<br></p><p><strong>9. Incorrect processing of&nbsp;payments</strong></p><p>9.1 Uber Payments will take all reasonable steps to rectify any payment processing errors. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the Partner in Uber Payments' administration. These actions may be performed by Uber Payments or a third party.						 								<br>9.2  If Uber Payments processes a Pay-out on the basis of the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) (or other unique identifier) provided by the Partner, Uber Payments is deemed to have correctly processed the Pay-out. Uber Payments is not obliged vis-à-vis the Partner to check whether the IBAN given to Uber Payments is correct and whether the name and IBAN of the account holder to which the Pay-out is made correspond.<br>		<br>9.3  Uber Payments will not be liable for Pay-outs if the Partner provides an incorrect IBAN. The Partner may request Uber Payments to assist in retrieving the amount transferred to an incorrect IBAN provided by the Partner, in which case Uber Payments will undertake reasonable efforts to assist the Partner, including providing the Partner with relevant information in Uber Payments' possession that the Partner needs for reclaiming the amounts paid. Fees may be charged for this&nbsp;assistance.</p><p><strong>10. Interest<br> 								<br></strong>Uber Payments will not pay any interest over the Pay-out Amount or any other funds held by Uber Payments or the Custodian and designated for a&nbsp;Partner.<strong>		</strong></p><p><strong>11. Costs<br></strong>		<br>11.1  Fees for providing the Payment Services form part of the fee agreed in the Agreement. Uber Payments will not charge any additional fees to such fees agreed upon under the Agreement.<br>		<br>11.2  Any other costs pursuant to the Payments Terms shall be for the account of the Partner and due to Uber as&nbsp;Fees.</p><p><strong>12.&nbsp;Liability</strong></p><p><br>12.1  Uber Payments, the Custodian and each of their Affiliates are not liable under or relating to the Agreement or the Payments Terms for any of the following damages, irrespective of whether it is based on a contract, wrongful act or any other legal theory, even if a party has been informed about the possible occurrence of the damage: (i) any incidental, punitive, special, exemplary, consequential, or other indirect damages of any type or kind; or (ii) Partner's or any third party’s property damage, or loss or inaccuracy of data, or loss of business, revenue, profits, use or other economic advantage.<br>		<br>12.2  The Partner confirms and agrees that all claims that the Partner has or means to have against Uber Payments, the Custodian and each of their Affiliates and subsidiaries should be disclosed to Uber Payments within one (1) year after the event that gave rise to the claim and that the Partner forfeits all claims if it fails to meet this obligation. These limitations do not intend to limit or exclude the liability of Uber Payments and its Affiliates and subsidiaries in a manner that contravenes the applicable&nbsp;law.</p><p></p><p><strong>13.&nbsp;Indemnification</strong></p><p><strong>								<br></strong>The Partner shall indemnify, defend (at Uber’s option) and hold harmless Uber, Uber Payments, the Custodian and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all liabilities, expenses (including legal fees), damages, penalties, fines, social security contributions and taxes arising out of or related to: (a) Partner's breach of its representations, warranties or obligations under the Payments Terms; or (b) a claim by a third party (including Users, regulators and governmental authorities) directly or indirectly related to Partner's provision of&nbsp;Services.</p><p><strong><br>14. Term and Termination<br> </strong>	<br>14.1  The Payments Terms commence on the later of (i) the date on which they become applicable in accordance with Article 1.5 or (ii) the date on which the Agreement is entered into by the Partner and shall continue until terminated as set forth herein.<br>		<br>14.2  The Payments Terms are terminated with immediate effect in the event of the termination of the Agreement between Uber and the Partner.<br>		<br>14.3  In addition, Uber Payments may immediately, without notice terminate the Agreement if (i) a Partner has materially breached an obligations under the Payments Terms; (ii) a Partner has provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated, or incomplete information; (iii) a Partner has violated applicable laws, regulations, or third-party rights; (iv) the Partner is declared insolvent or bankrupt, or the Partner has submitted or sent a request for deferment of payment (or any similar action or event) to Uber or Uber Payments or (v) Uber Payments believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect other Partners, Uber, Uber Payments, the Custodian or third parties (for example in the case of fraudulent behavior of a Partner).<br>	<br>14.4  In addition, Uber Payments is entitled to terminate the Payments Terms or to immediately suspend the Partner, without prior notice, if the provision of the Services by the Partner through the Uber Platforms is no longer in accordance with the applicable law or the standards and policies of Uber or as otherwise set out in the Agreement or the Payments Terms.<br>		<br>14.5  A notice by the Partner to Uber Payments to terminate the Payments Terms may be deemed by Uber as a notice to terminate the&nbsp;Agreement.</p><p>14.6 If the Payments Terms are terminated, Uber Payments will not accept any new Partner Charges and will Pay-out any Pay-out Amount to the Partner (if any) as soon as possible in accordance with the final sentence of Article 6.1. The Payments Terms shall survive up and until the moment that all outstanding payment obligations of Uber Payments and the Partner have been&nbsp;satisfied.</p><p><strong>15. Modification and additional&nbsp;terms</strong></p><p><br>15.1  Uber Payments reserves the right at any time to modify these Payments Terms with a notice period of 1 months before the proposed date of application, where the modifications take effect after the publication of an updated version of the Payments Terms on the Uber Platforms. If there is a change in applicable legislation and/or regulations, Uber Payments reserves the right to immediately modify these Payments Terms. Uber Payments also reserves the right to modify information that is referred to via hyperlinks in the Payments Terms, if any, as appropriate. The Partner confirms and agrees that by using the services provided via the Uber Platforms, the Partner is bound to future modifications and additions to these Payments Terms and information referred to through the hyperlinks contained in these Payment Terms (including modifications and additions in relation to the Partner Charges). Continued use of the Uber Services and/or the Payment Services provided via the Uber Platforms after such changes means that the Partner agrees to such modifications. In the event that the Partner does not agree to the modified terms, the Partner can terminate the Agreement in accordance with its terms and consequently terminate the Payments Terms free of charge pursuant to Article 14.2.<br> 								<br>15.2  Additional terms and conditions may apply to the Payment Services. The Partner may, if applicable, be offered these additional terms and conditions. Additional terms and conditions are in addition to, and are deemed to be part of, the Agreement and these Payments Terms. In the event of conflict, the additional terms prevail over these Payments&nbsp;Terms.<br></p><p><strong>16. Miscellaneous&nbsp;Terms</strong></p><p><br>16.1  If any (part of a) provision of these Payments Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. In that case, the parties will replace the invalid and unenforceable (part of the) provision for a (part of a) provision that is legal, valid and enforceable and which has to the greatest possible extent a comparable effect as the unlawful, invalid or unenforceable (part of the) provisions with regard to the content and the purpose of the Payments Terms.<br> 								<br>16.2  The Partner does not have the right to assign or transfer the Payments Terms or the rights or obligations arising from it, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Uber Payments. Uber Payments has the right to assign or transfer the Payments Terms or the rights or obligations arising therefrom in whole or in part without the Partner's&nbsp;permission.</p><p><br>16.3  These Payments Terms, including any additional terms and conditions, constitute the agreement and the arrangement of the parties with respect to the subject and replaces and supersedes all previous and temporary and simultaneous agreements or arrangements regarding the subject matter. In the Payments Terms, the words "inclusive" and "include" mean "including, but not limited to". The considerations form part of the Payments Terms.<br> 			<br>16.4  The Partner confirms that there are no external beneficiaries to the Agreement and Payments Terms, other than Uber and the Custodian. Nothing that is included in the Payments Terms is intended, or may be construed as creating claims on behalf of third parties. In derogation hereof, Uber and the Custodian can benefit from the Payments Terms as a third party beneficiary in respect of the Articles in the Payments Terms conferring rights upon Uber and the Custodian. This is a third party stipulation (<em>derdenbeding</em>) as referred to in article 6:253(1) Netherlands Civil Code for the benefit of Uber and the Custodian.<br> 				<br>16.5  Any notice provided by Uber and/or Uber Payments to the Partner under the Agreement and under these Payments Terms will be sent by e-mail to the e-mail address related to the Partner's account with Uber, or by placement on the online portal available to the Partner on the Uber Platforms.

Upon Merchant agreeing to the Order Form, Definitions, General Supplemental Terms and Specific Supplemental Terms governing the Marketplace Method, and contingent upon completion of any additional verification steps, the Uber Tools will be made available to Merchant to access and request on-demand delivery services performed by Marketplace Couriers. The Uber Eats Services in connection with the Marketplace Method include, without limitation: (a) providing on-demand lead generation, logistics, payment processing, marketing, onboarding, operational and other support services in connection with the sale of Marketplace Items by Merchant via the Uber Eats App; and (b) enabling Merchant to access and request on-demand delivery services performed by Marketplace&nbsp;Couriers.</li><li><strong>Payment</strong>. <ol><li><u>Marketplace Service Fee</u>. In consideration for the Uber Eats Services in connection with the Marketplace Method, Uber Ireland will charge Merchant a Marketplace Service Fee in the amount set out in the Order Form for each Marketplace Item sold by Merchant via the Uber Eats App. Uber Ireland will calculate the Marketplace Service Fee as follows: the Retail Price of the Item(s) sold by Merchant via the Uber Eats App (including any VAT or other sales tax) (the "Marketplace Item Payment") multiplied by the Marketplace Service Fee percentage.

If for whatever reason Marketplace Courier’s electronic payment to Uber and/or its Affiliates is delayed or unsuccessful, Uber and/or its Affiliates, in its capacity as Merchant’s collection agent, will act as a fall-back and ensure receipt of payment by Merchant. Merchant acknowledges and agrees that in consideration of Uber Ireland’s provision of lead generation, demand prediction, and other related services provided via the Uber Eats App under the Agreement, Merchant owes Uber Ireland the respective Marketplace Service Fee, regardless of collections related to the attempted or completed deliveries.

In the event of  any conflict between these Sponsored Listing Terms and the Order Form, the Definitions or the General Supplemental Terms, these Sponsored Listing Terms shall govern as applied to the subject matter&nbsp;herein.</p><p>By submitting a Bid you are accepting and agree to be bound by these Sponsored Listing Terms at all times when using the Ads Manager to create Campaigns, submit Bids and in with respect to all Sponsored Listings and Sponsored Listing&nbsp;Fees.</p><h3><a id="_30j0zll"></a><strong>1. Definitions. </strong></h3><p>In these Sponsored Listing Terms, the following terms have the respective meanings given to them&nbsp;below:</p><p><strong>“Ads Manager” </strong>means Uber’s proprietary, automated, self-service tool located within the Uber Tools, used to create&nbsp;Bids;</p><p><strong>“Bid” </strong>means an offer by you for a Sponsored Listing, subject to your Campaign Budget&nbsp;constraints;</p><p>"<strong>Brand Matter</strong>" means an event that, in Uber’s reasonable judgement, would jeopardise the ability of the Merchant to comply with or perform the Merchant Agreement or these Sponsored Listing Terms, or prejudice the goodwill or reputation of Uber or its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, matters related to the alleged violation of the Community Guidelines or any Applicable&nbsp;Laws.</p><p>“<strong>Campaign</strong>” means a sustained period of time for which you agree in advance to make&nbsp;Bids;</p><p>“<strong>Campaign Period</strong>” means the length of time for which your Sponsored Listing&nbsp;appears;</p><p>“<strong>Campaign Budget</strong>” means the amount authorised by you to spend on Sponsored Listing&nbsp;Fees;</p><p>“<strong>Sponsored Listing</strong>” means a placement on the Uber Eats App which: (a) subject to Uber’s discretion, will include some indicator to customers that the placement was purchased by you, such as a tag such as  “promoted” or “sponsored”; (b) will appear in the Uber Eats App (and may appear on the Uber Eats website) in a placement determined by Uber, or otherwise selected by you in your Bid submission; and (c) will be assembled and formatted based on the content provided in accordance with your Merchant&nbsp;Agreement.</p><p>“<strong>Sponsored Listing Fee</strong>” means an amount based on the actual number of clicks on your Sponsored Listing at the rate determined by Uber for each&nbsp;placement;</p><p><strong>“Uber Ads Representative”</strong> means an Uber representative who you authorise to make the changes described in these Sponsored Listing Terms.

Sponsored Listings. </strong></h3><p>Subject to these Sponsored Listing Terms, Uber authorises Merchant to submit Bids. A detailed explanation of how Sponsored Listings work, including information on placement, and the auction and selection process, can be found at https://restaurants.ubereats.com/sponsored-listings/. A selected Sponsored Listing will be placed on the Uber Eats App.  For clarity, a Sponsored Listing may be posted anytime after it is selected and will continue to appear until the Campaign Budget is exhausted, until Uber removes it for any reason permitted by these Sponsored Listing Terms, or until you end the campaign in accordance with Section&nbsp;6.</p><h3><a id="_3znysh7"></a><strong>3.  Creating Campaigns. </strong></h3><p>When you use the Ads Manager or instruct an Uber Ads Representative to create a Bid on your behalf, you authorise Uber to assemble and format Sponsored Listings based on the content provided in accordance with your Merchant Agreement. Uber may, in its sole discretion, limit access to the Ads Manager, restrict the merchants or categories of merchants who can create Sponsored Listings, limit the number of Sponsored Listings you can create at a given time, and limit the availability of any or all of the Sponsored Listings (for example, to listings from certain categories or containing certain attributes). By placing a Bid, you acknowledge that you may or may not obtain a Sponsored Listing. You acknowledge that each Bid submitted is placed in an auction; submission of a Bid does not guarantee a Sponsored&nbsp;Listing.</p><p><strong><em>a.</em></strong> <strong><em>Uber created Bids.</em></strong> If you have an Uber Ads Representative, and have agreed in writing that such Uber Ads Representative may place Bids on your behalf, you agree to provide authorisation in advance to such representatives before any Bids are placed, indicating that you wish to create Sponsored Listings, your weekly budget for each Merchant location, and any other supported&nbsp;criteria.</p><p><strong><em>b. Self-Serve Ads Manager.  </em></strong>You agree to only use and access such Ads Manager within its functionality and technical capability, recognise that such tool is proprietary to Uber and will not circumvent or otherwise exploit the tool in such a way that is not intended. For clarity, the rights and obligations in the Merchant Agreement relating to Uber Tools shall apply to Ads&nbsp;Manager.</p><p><strong><em>c. Authorisation of Spending.  </em></strong>Upon submission of a Bid, you agree that you will be obligated to spend up to your authorised Campaign Budget amount if your Bid is selected. Uber will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure your Campaign Budget is not&nbsp;exceeded.</p><p><strong><em>d. Content for Sponsored Listings.</em></strong> The content included in the Sponsored Listing will be the Merchant Marketing Materials provided under the Merchant Agreement, or other videos, still images or materials provided by Merchant to Uber and used in connection with the display of Merchant’s Items on the Uber Eats App (“<strong>Merchant Material</strong>”). You are responsible for ensuring that the Merchant Material complies with all Applicable Laws and applicable advertising codes and guidance. Uber reserves the right to remove any Sponsored Listing if it reasonably believes the Merchant Material breaches the terms of the Merchant Agreement or may cause a Brand Matter. Uber will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your Sponsored Listings and you acknowledge that any Sponsored Listings shown in preview or surfaced prior may be changed in Uber’s sole&nbsp;discretion.</p><h3><a id="_2et92p0"></a><strong>4. Your Responsibilities. </strong></h3><p>You will be solely responsible for the payment of the Sponsored Listing Fees, whether such Bid was submitted by you or another Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merchant Agreement, in the event of a termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms in accordance with Section 7 or the end of a Campaign, you agree that you will be obligated to pay the Sponsored Listing Fees up until the end of the Campaign or the effective date of termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms.  You agree to limit access to Ads Manager to validated and authorised Representatives or anyone else acting on your behalf. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your Representatives and their actions in connection with their use of Ads Manager. You will ensure that your Representatives comply with all restrictions applicable to you under these Sponsored Listing Terms and all applicable third-party rights, laws, rules and&nbsp;regulations.</p><h3><a id="_tyjcwt"></a><strong>5.  Uber Responsibilities. </strong></h3><p>Uber will provide you with reasonable information, no later than the end of the month in which the Sponsored Listing appears, regarding your Sponsored Listing(s), which will include your Sponsored Listing Fees, associated performance metrics and any other information required by Applicable Laws. Subject to the functionality of the Ads Manager, Uber may, in its sole discretion, provide enhanced promotional placement or other visual treatment for the Sponsored Listings. Merchant acknowledges that the time period of the Sponsored Listing may vary due to a number of factors including Merchant’s Campaign Budget as authorised in an applicable Bid, parameters set by Uber in our sole discretion and the Ads Manager&nbsp;functionality.</p><h3><a id="_3dy6vkm"></a><strong>6.  Fees.  </strong></h3><p>Sponsored Listing Fees are exclusive of any VAT or other sales taxes. If applicable,  VAT and/or other sales taxes shall be charged and collected in the same manner as Sponsored Listing Fees. Uber may charge different rates for different placements of a Sponsored Listing upon notice to you. For clarity, you won’t be charged a fee for access to the Ads Manager or for placing a Sponsored Listing via an Uber Ads&nbsp;Representative.</p><p><strong><em>a. Invoicing and Payment&nbsp;Schedule.</em></strong></p><p>Uber will charge the Sponsored Listing Fees to you. You agree that unless otherwise agreed in writing, Uber or its affiliates will deduct the Sponsored Listing Fees from any payment due to you, such as a deduction from the remittance of Item Revenue collected on each Merchant’s behalf. Further, we may continue to deduct such Sponsored Listing Fees from following weekly payouts until such time when the Sponsored Listing Fees are paid in full. If agreed by Uber in writing, Uber may invoice you in arrears for the amount of the Sponsored Listing Fees, which shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days of your receipt of such invoice. In both instances, collection of the Sponsored Listing Fee will take place after placement of a Sponsored Listing. Subject to the foregoing, Uber reserves the right to set a maximum spend threshold or suspend your access to the Ads Manager until the Sponsored Listing Fees are paid in full. Uber reserves the right to offer credits and/or discounts to fully or partially fund the Sponsored Listing Fees, which may be subject to a limited time period or other restrictions, at Uber’s sole discretion. Uber and affiliates further reserve the right to collect Sponsored Listing Fees by debiting the payment method or your bank account on record, or otherwise seeking reimbursement from you by any lawful collection methods available. Any disputes about Sponsored Listing Fees must be submitted to Uber in writing within 14 days of the date you incurred such charge, otherwise you waive such dispute and such charge will be final and not subject to&nbsp;challenge.</p><p><strong><em>b. Charged per Click.&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Based on the budget defined in your Bid submission, Uber will calculate your Sponsored Listing Fees based on the price per click. Sponsored Listing Fees are determined at the rate in effect for a particular Sponsored Listing at the time it is clicked. You understand that third parties may generate impressions or clicks on your Sponsored Listing for unintended purposes and you acknowledge and agree that you may still be charged for such clicks. See https://restaurants.ubereats.com/sponsored-listings/ for more information on the auction and bidding&nbsp;process.</p><h3><a id="_1t3h5sf"></a><strong>7.  Termination. </strong></h3><p>You may cancel a Bid at any time, provided, however, that your Sponsored Listing(s) may run up to 3 business days after such cancellation. You will be responsible for the Sponsored Listing Fees until the Bid is cancelled. Upon cancellation, these Sponsored Listing Terms shall automatically terminate, provided, however, termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms will not result in termination of the Agreement unless the party terminating these Sponsored Listing Terms also terminates the Agreement in accordance with its terms. Termination of the Agreement will automatically result in termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms or the Agreement will not relieve either party of its pre-existing obligations&nbsp;hereunder.</p><h3><a id="_4d34og8"></a><strong>8.  Data.  </strong></h3><p>Uber shall grant you a limited, exclusive, revocable, license to certain data for free and aggregated reporting related to such Sponsored Listings.  Such license shall expire upon termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms or any superseding terms.  You will undertake reasonable commercial and technological efforts to prevent unauthorised access or copying of such data by third parties and you will protect, and prevent, such aggregated and anonymised data from being attributed to individual users of the Uber Tools by yourself or third parties. You agree that Uber may share Uber Data with third-party service providers for the purposes of providing Sponsored Listings. In case Uber Data is also considered Merchant’s Personal Data in accordance with Applicable Laws, the information provided in, and the rights afforded under, Uber’s privacy notice shall supersede this paragraph in case of a&nbsp;conflict.</p><h3><a id="_2s8eyo1"></a><strong>9.  Feedback. </strong></h3><p>You understand and acknowledge that the form and function of the Ads Manager may change at any time in Uber’s sole discretion. You understand and agree that you may voluntarily provide and/or submit to Uber Feedback, during the Sponsored Listing, and the terms of the Merchant Agreement shall apply to such&nbsp;Feedback.</p><h3><a id="_17dp8vu"></a><strong>10.  Testing. </strong></h3><p>You authorise Uber to periodically conduct non-material tests that may affect your access to or use of the Ads Manager, as well as your ability to surface Sponsored Listings. These tests may include, but are not limited to, changes in formatting, or placement of Sponsored Listings. Uber will provide you with at least 15 days’ notice of any testing which may have a material impact on the performance of your Sponsored Listing. In any case, you shall only pay on a per click basis for your Sponsored Listing (as described in Section 5(a)&nbsp;above).</p><h3><a id="_3rdcrjn"></a><strong>11. Confidentiality.</strong></h3><p><strong> </strong>For the avoidance of doubt, all elements, including any design features and components offered and displayed (whether orally, visually, or in writing) of the Uber Eats Sponsored Listing program, including the existence and structure of the Uber Eats Sponsored Listing program, are confidential and should be handled in accordance with the confidentiality obligations in the Merchant&nbsp;Agreement.</p><h3><a id="_26in1rg"></a><strong>12. Disclaimer. </strong></h3><p>Except for the express warranties stated herein, neither party makes, and each party expressly disclaims, all representations and warranties, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter of these Sponsored Listing Terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Uber makes no representation or warranty as to the benefit that Merchant will obtain from the Sponsored Listings. Moreover, Uber does not represent or warrant that the Ads Manager will be error-free, always available or operate without loss or corruption of data or technical&nbsp;malfunction.</p><h3><a id="_lnxbz9"></a><strong>13.  Other. </strong></h3><p>These Sponsored Listing Terms may be superseded and replaced by subsequent terms and conditions located at: <a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/en/"><u>https://www.uber.com/legal/en/</u></a> or in the Ads Manager, upon 15 days’ written or electronic notice by Uber. By continuing to submit Bids after the notice period, you agree to be bound by any subsequent terms and conditions relating to the activities described in these Sponsored Listing Terms. Uber reserves the right, at any time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Ads Manager or the ability for Merchant to place Bids, with or without notice. You agree that neither Uber nor any of its affiliates<strong> </strong>shall be liable to you (or to any third party) for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Ads Manager or providing you with the ability to place Bids. Each party acknowledges that the arrangements contemplated hereby are non-exclusive and nothing herein shall be deemed to restrict or limit Uber's ability to engage in similar relationships, agreements or arrangements with any other party. Except as specifically amended by these Sponsored Listing Terms, the terms and conditions of the Merchant Agreement and any amendments thereto shall remain in full force and&nbsp;effect.</p><a id="kix.brm3j8fezfmm"></a><h3><a id="_gtdhrotfeuuy"></a><strong><u>Uber Promotion Tools Terms and Conditions </u></strong></h3><p>The following Specific Supplemental Terms (“Promotion Terms”) allow you to use Uber's Offer Tools to feature short-term promotions that are designed and fulfilled by you to potentially stimulate customer demand.

Merchant authorizes Uber to use automated tools to feature Offers within the Uber Eats App. Unless otherwise specified by Uber, Merchant will be solely responsible for defining each Offer (within the scope of functionality provided by the Offer Tools), including, without limitation, the start date, end date, and budget for each Offer, but each Offer will be subject to Uber’s prior written approval. Merchant is responsible for providing to Uber, at the Merchant’s sole cost and expense, all Offer Materials within deadlines specified by Uber for such to be reproduced for the fulfillment of the Offer.

Merchant acknowledges that the time period of enhanced promotional placement for an Offer may be subject to a number of factors, including but not limited to Merchant’s budget for such Offer, the start and end date for an Offer identified by Merchant, and Uber Eats App&nbsp;functionality.</p><h4><a id="_eqjkriin5neq"></a><strong>2. Your Responsibilities.</strong></h4><p>Merchant is the promoter of each Offer.

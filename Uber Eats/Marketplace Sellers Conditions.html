Payment services provided by Uber Payments on behalf of&nbsp;Uber</strong></p><p>5.1 Uber Payments enables the Partner to receive payments from the User or another Partner for Services that the Partner provides through an Uber Platform. The Partner therefore agrees that Uber Payments will accept and process payment transactions, including E-money transactions. More specifically, Uber Payments receives any funds due by the User or another Partner (the Partner Charges) or Uber (the Uber Amounts) on behalf of the Partner. Upon receiving the funds, Uber Payments deducts any applicable Fees and pays out the remainder to the Partner (the Pay-out Amount) as set-out in Article&nbsp;7.</p><p>5.2 Uber Payments administers the Pay-out Amount in the name of the Partner. Uber Payments will only transfer the Pay-out Amount to a Partner (Pay-out) if it has received the full amount (including Fees) from a User or another Partner or another payment service provider (and in the event of an Uber Amount, from Uber) for the Services and if such transfer is in accordance with the Agreement and the Payments&nbsp;Terms.</p><p><strong>6.

Any such transfer of the P2P Charge will be administered by the Custodian.<br>	<br>6.3  Uber Payments will transfer the Pay-out Amount to the Partner in the currency in which the Partner Charge was received by the Custodian.<br>	<br>6.4  Uber Payments will arrange for Pay-out to the bank account as designated by the Partner on the relevant Uber Platform. The Partner may only designate a bank account that is administered in its own name for Pay-out. Any changes of the bank account must be notified to Uber Payments as soon as possible. The Partner represents and warrants that the bank account designated by it on the Uber Platform is a bank account administered in its own name.<br> 		<br>6.5  The Partner authorizes Uber Payments to use the Partner Charges (including for the avoidance of doubt, the P2P Charge) to satisfy all claims of Uber or third parties vis-à-vis the Partner under or pursuant to the Agreement and/or the Payments Terms. Uber Payments is authorized to deduct the amount of such claims from the Partner Charges and transfer such amounts to Uber and itself. Uber Payments shall in this respect be entitled to solely rely on the information it receives from Uber as binding evidence of such amounts due by the Partner. The Partner may provide evidence to the&nbsp;contrary.</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;Pay-out</strong></p><p>7.1  Uber, Uber Payments and the Partner can agree that Pay-out takes place on a specific incidental or recurring date. Such agreement constitutes an instruction for Pay-out. Such instruction for Pay-out will be regarded as having been received by Uber Payments on the moment that the Partner indicates on the relevant Uber Platform that it wishes to receive Pay-out and the agreement to that instruction has been confirmed by Uber on its behalf and on behalf of Uber Payments.<br>			<br>7.2  Any instruction for Pay-out received by (or on behalf of) Uber Payments (a) on a day that is not a Business Day or (b) after 17:00 Amsterdam time on a Business Day will be regarded as having been received on the next Business Day.<br>		<br>7.3  If Pay-out takes place in euros, Uber Payments will ensure that the account of the bank holding such account is credited with the Pay-out amount no later than on the end of the first Business Day immediately following the receipt of the instruction for Pay-out in accordance with these Payments Terms.<br>		<br>7.4  If Pay-out takes place in a currency of an EEA country, but other than euros, Uber Payments will ensure that the account of the bank holding such account is credited with the Pay-out amount no later than the end of the fourth Business Day following the receipt of the instruction for Pay-out in accordance with these Payments Terms.<br>			<br>7.5  In all circumstances other than as described in Articles 7.3 and 7.4, Uber Payments will ensure that Pay-out takes place within a reasonable term.<br>		<br>7.6  Uber Payments will make the Pay-out Amount available for Pay-out to the Partner as soon as the amount has been credited to the Custodian's bank&nbsp;account.</p><p><strong>8. Refusal and limitations on&nbsp;Pay-out</strong></p><p>8.1 Uber Payments may at any time (at its own discretion) decide not to pay-out any Pay-out Amount to a Partner&nbsp;if:</p><ul><li>an attachment has been levied under Uber Payments and/or the Custodian in respect of the&nbsp;Partner;</li><li>Transferring such an amount would conflict with the law or other applicable national or international regulations, relevant guidance or instructions from a competent regulator or a binding judicial order or&nbsp;verdict;</li><li>Uber Payments considers it reasonable and necessary not to the pay-out such amount, for example because that would conflict with its internal policies or applicable&nbsp;procedures;</li><li>The Partner acts in violation of the Agreement or the&nbsp;PaymentsTerms;</li><li>Uber or Uber Payments has a suspicion of fraud by the&nbsp;Partner.</li></ul><p>8.2  For compliance or operational reasons, Uber Payments may limit the amount of each individual Pay-out. If the total amount owed to a Partner is at any time higher than the limit determined by Uber Payments in accordance with the previous sentence, Uber Payments may initiate a series of Pay-outs in one day or on subsequent days.<br>			<br>8.3  If Uber Payments refuses Pay-out, Uber or Uber Payments will notify the Partner as soon as possible of the reasons for this refusal and of the procedure for correcting any factual errors that led to the refusal, and no later than the end of the periods indicated in Articles 7.3 - 7.5, as applicable. Any such notification will be made through the Uber Platforms. Uber and Uber Payments shall not be required to notify the Partner if such notification is prohibited by the laws applicable to it or is prohibited by a competent court or regulator.<br> 		<br>8.4  Uber Payments may limit or temporarily or permanently suspend a Partner's access to the Payment Services (i) to comply with applicable law, or the order or request of a court, law enforcement, a regulator or other administrative agency or governmental body, or if (ii) a Partner has breached the Payments Terms, the Agreement, applicable laws, regulations or third-party rights, (iii) a Partner has provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated, or incomplete information under the Payments Terms or the Agreement, or (iv) Uber Payments believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of Uber, Uber Payments, the Custodian, Users, other Partners, or third parties, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity.<br>		<br>8.5  Partners are responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and tax obligations that may apply to the use of the Payment Services. In connection with the use of the Payment Services, Partners may not and Partners agree that they will not and will not assist or enable others to:	 										<br>a.	breach or circumvent any applicable laws or regulations, agreements with third parties, third-party rights, the Agreement and/or the Payments Terms;								 										<br>b. 	use the Payment Services for any commercial or other purposes that are not expressly permitted by the Agreement and/or the Payments Terms;<br>							<br>c. 	take any action that damages or adversely affects, or could damage or adversely affect, the performance or proper functioning of the Payment&nbsp;Services;<br></p><p><strong>9. Incorrect processing of&nbsp;payments</strong></p><p>9.1 Uber Payments will take all reasonable steps to rectify any payment processing errors. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the Partner in Uber Payments' administration. These actions may be performed by Uber Payments or a third party.						 								<br>9.2  If Uber Payments processes a Pay-out on the basis of the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) (or other unique identifier) provided by the Partner, Uber Payments is deemed to have correctly processed the Pay-out. Uber Payments is not obliged vis-à-vis the Partner to check whether the IBAN given to Uber Payments is correct and whether the name and IBAN of the account holder to which the Pay-out is made correspond.<br>		<br>9.3  Uber Payments will not be liable for Pay-outs if the Partner provides an incorrect IBAN. The Partner may request Uber Payments to assist in retrieving the amount transferred to an incorrect IBAN provided by the Partner, in which case Uber Payments will undertake reasonable efforts to assist the Partner, including providing the Partner with relevant information in Uber Payments' possession that the Partner needs for reclaiming the amounts paid. Fees may be charged for this&nbsp;assistance.</p><p><strong>10.

Content for Sponsored Listings.</em></strong> The content included in the Sponsored Listing will be the Merchant Marketing Materials provided under the Merchant Agreement, or other videos, still images or materials provided by Merchant to Uber and used in connection with the display of Merchant’s Items on the Uber Eats App (“<strong>Merchant Material</strong>”). You are responsible for ensuring that the Merchant Material complies with all Applicable Laws and applicable advertising codes and guidance. Uber reserves the right to remove any Sponsored Listing if it reasonably believes the Merchant Material breaches the terms of the Merchant Agreement or may cause a Brand Matter. Uber will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your Sponsored Listings and you acknowledge that any Sponsored Listings shown in preview or surfaced prior may be changed in Uber’s sole&nbsp;discretion.</p><h3><a id="_3fwokq0"></a><strong>4. Your Responsibilities. </strong></h3><p>You will be solely responsible for the payment of the Sponsored Listing Fees, whether such Bid was submitted by you or another Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merchant Agreement, in the event of a termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms in accordance with Section 7 or the end of a Campaign, you agree that you will be obligated to pay the Sponsored Listing Fees up until the end of the Campaign or the effective date of termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms.  You agree to limit access to Ads Manager to validated and authorised Representatives or anyone else acting on your behalf. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your Representatives and their actions in connection with their use of Ads Manager. You will ensure that your Representatives comply with all restrictions applicable to you under these Sponsored Listing Terms and all applicable third-party rights, laws, rules and&nbsp;regulations.</p><h3><a id="_1v1yuxt"></a><strong>5.  Uber Responsibilities. </strong></h3><p>Uber will provide you with reasonable information, no later than the end of the month in which the Sponsored Listing appears, regarding your Sponsored Listing(s), which will include your Sponsored Listing Fees, associated performance metrics and any other information required by Applicable Laws. Subject to the functionality of the Ads Manager, Uber may, in its sole discretion, provide enhanced promotional placement or other visual treatment for the Sponsored Listings. Merchant acknowledges that the time period of the Sponsored Listing may vary due to a number of factors including Merchant’s Campaign Budget as authorised in an applicable Bid, parameters set by Uber in our sole discretion and the Ads Manager&nbsp;functionality.</p><h3><a id="_4f1mdlm"></a><strong>6.  Fees.  </strong></h3><p>Sponsored Listing Fees are exclusive of any VAT or other sales taxes. If applicable,  VAT and/or other sales taxes shall be charged and collected in the same manner as Sponsored Listing Fees. Uber may charge different rates for different placements of a Sponsored Listing upon notice to you. For clarity, you won’t be charged a fee for access to the Ads Manager or for placing a Sponsored Listing via an Uber Ads&nbsp;Representative.</p><p><strong><em>a. Invoicing and Payment&nbsp;Schedule.</em></strong></p><p>Uber will charge the Sponsored Listing Fees to you. You agree that unless otherwise agreed in writing, Uber or its affiliates will deduct the Sponsored Listing Fees from any payment due to you, such as a deduction from the remittance of Item Revenue collected on each Merchant’s behalf. Further, we may continue to deduct such Sponsored Listing Fees from following weekly payouts until such time when the Sponsored Listing Fees are paid in full. If agreed by Uber in writing, Uber may invoice you in arrears for the amount of the Sponsored Listing Fees, which shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days of your receipt of such invoice. In both instances, collection of the Sponsored Listing Fee will take place after placement of a Sponsored Listing. Subject to the foregoing, Uber reserves the right to set a maximum spend threshold or suspend your access to the Ads Manager until the Sponsored Listing Fees are paid in full. Uber reserves the right to offer credits and/or discounts to fully or partially fund the Sponsored Listing Fees, which may be subject to a limited time period or other restrictions, at Uber’s sole discretion. Uber and affiliates further reserve the right to collect Sponsored Listing Fees by debiting the payment method or your bank account on record, or otherwise seeking reimbursement from you by any lawful collection methods available. Any disputes about Sponsored Listing Fees must be submitted to Uber in writing within 14 days of the date you incurred such charge, otherwise you waive such dispute and such charge will be final and not subject to&nbsp;challenge.</p><p><strong><em>b. Charged per Click.&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Based on the budget defined in your Bid submission, Uber will calculate your Sponsored Listing Fees based on the price per click. Sponsored Listing Fees are determined at the rate in effect for a particular Sponsored Listing at the time it is clicked. You understand that third parties may generate impressions or clicks on your Sponsored Listing for unintended purposes and you acknowledge and agree that you may still be charged for such clicks. See https://restaurants.ubereats.com/sponsored-listings/ for more information on the auction and bidding&nbsp;process.</p><h3><a id="_2u6wntf"></a><strong>7.  Termination. </strong></h3><p>You may cancel a Bid at any time, provided, however, that your Sponsored Listing(s) may run up to 3 business days after such cancellation. You will be responsible for the Sponsored Listing Fees until the Bid is cancelled. Upon cancellation, these Sponsored Listing Terms shall automatically terminate, provided, however, termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms will not result in termination of the Agreement unless the party terminating these Sponsored Listing Terms also terminates the Agreement in accordance with its terms. Termination of the Agreement will automatically result in termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms or the Agreement will not relieve either party of its pre-existing obligations&nbsp;hereunder.</p><h3><a id="_19c6y18"></a><strong>8.  Data.  </strong></h3><p>Uber shall grant you a limited, exclusive, revocable, license to certain data for free and aggregated reporting related to such Sponsored Listings.  Such license shall expire upon termination of these Sponsored Listing Terms or any superseding terms.  You will undertake reasonable commercial and technological efforts to prevent unauthorised access or copying of such data by third parties and you will protect, and prevent, such aggregated and anonymised data from being attributed to individual users of the Uber Tools by yourself or third parties. You agree that Uber may share Uber Data with third-party service providers for the purposes of providing Sponsored Listings. In case Uber Data is also considered Merchant’s Personal Data in accordance with Applicable Laws, the information provided in, and the rights afforded under, Uber’s privacy notice shall supersede this paragraph in case of a&nbsp;conflict.</p><h3><a id="_3tbugp1"></a><strong>9.  Feedback. </strong></h3><p>You understand and acknowledge that the form and function of the Ads Manager may change at any time in Uber’s sole discretion. You understand and agree that you may voluntarily provide and/or submit to Uber Feedback, during the Sponsored Listing, and the terms of the Merchant Agreement shall apply to such&nbsp;Feedback.</p><h3><a id="_28h4qwu"></a><strong>10.  Testing. </strong></h3><p>You authorise Uber to periodically conduct non-material tests that may affect your access to or use of the Ads Manager, as well as your ability to surface Sponsored Listings. These tests may include, but are not limited to, changes in formatting, or placement of Sponsored Listings. Uber will provide you with at least 15 days’ notice of any testing which may have a material impact on the performance of your Sponsored Listing. In any case, you shall only pay on a per click basis for your Sponsored Listing (as described in Section 5(a)&nbsp;above).</p><h3><a id="_nmf14n"></a><strong>11. Confidentiality.</strong></h3><p><strong> </strong>For the avoidance of doubt, all elements, including any design features and components offered and displayed (whether orally, visually, or in writing) of the Uber Eats Sponsored Listing program, including the existence and structure of the Uber Eats Sponsored Listing program, are confidential and should be handled in accordance with the confidentiality obligations in the Merchant&nbsp;Agreement.</p><h3><a id="_37m2jsg"></a><strong>12. Disclaimer. </strong></h3><p>Except for the express warranties stated herein, neither party makes, and each party expressly disclaims, all representations and warranties, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter of these Sponsored Listing Terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Uber makes no representation or warranty as to the benefit that Merchant will obtain from the Sponsored Listings. Moreover, Uber does not represent or warrant that the Ads Manager will be error-free, always available or operate without loss or corruption of data or technical&nbsp;malfunction.</p><h3><a id="_1mrcu09"></a><strong>13.  Other. </strong></h3><p>These Sponsored Listing Terms may be superseded and replaced by subsequent terms and conditions located at: <a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/en/"><u>https://www.uber.com/legal/en/</u></a> or in the Ads Manager, upon 15 days’ written or electronic notice by Uber. By continuing to submit Bids after the notice period, you agree to be bound by any subsequent terms and conditions relating to the activities described in these Sponsored Listing Terms. Uber reserves the right, at any time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Ads Manager or the ability for Merchant to place Bids, with or without notice. You agree that neither Uber nor any of its affiliates<strong> </strong>shall be liable to you (or to any third party) for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Ads Manager or providing you with the ability to place Bids. Each party acknowledges that the arrangements contemplated hereby are non-exclusive and nothing herein shall be deemed to restrict or limit Uber's ability to engage in similar relationships, agreements or arrangements with any other party. Except as specifically amended by these Sponsored Listing Terms, the terms and conditions of the Merchant Agreement and any amendments thereto shall remain in full force and&nbsp;effect.</p><a id="kix.bqxt3dk777yv"></a><h3><a id="_2lwamvv"></a><strong><u>Uber Promotion Tools Terms and Conditions </u></strong></h3><p>The following Specific Supplemental Terms (“Promotion Terms”) allow you to use Uber's Offer Tools to feature short-term promotions that are designed and fulfilled by you to potentially stimulate customer demand. These Promotion Terms describe the requirements that apply to the Offer Tools and the circumstances in which you can choose to use the Offer Tools. All undefined, capitalized  terms will have the meaning set forth in the Order Form, the Definitions or the General Supplemental&nbsp;Terms.</p><h4><a id="_111kx3o"></a><strong>1. Merchant Offers Program and Offers.</strong></h4><p>Subject to these Promotion Terms, Uber hereby authorizes Merchant to use Uber’s proprietary, automated tools (“Offer Tools”) to feature short-term Merchant offers that are designed and fulfilled by the Merchant to stimulate customer demand, including, by way of example, the provision of discounts and special offers through the Uber Eats App (each such offer hereafter an “Offer”). Merchant authorizes Uber to use automated tools to feature Offers within the Uber Eats App. Unless otherwise specified by Uber, Merchant will be solely responsible for defining each Offer (within the scope of functionality provided by the Offer Tools), including, without limitation, the start date, end date, and budget for each Offer, but each Offer will be subject to Uber’s prior written approval. Merchant is responsible for providing to Uber, at the Merchant’s sole cost and expense, all Offer Materials within deadlines specified by Uber for such to be reproduced for the fulfillment of the Offer. Uber may, at its sole discretion, provide enhanced promotional placement or other visual treatment for an Offer through the start and end date identified by Merchant. Merchant acknowledges that the time period of enhanced promotional placement for an Offer may be subject to a number of factors, including but not limited to Merchant’s budget for such Offer, the start and end date for an Offer identified by Merchant, and Uber Eats App&nbsp;functionality.</p><h4><a id="_3l18frh"></a><strong>2. Your Responsibilities.</strong></h4><p>Merchant is the promoter of each Offer. You are solely responsible for fulfilling the terms of each Offer provided by you to your customers, and you are likewise solely responsible for providing and enforcing terms, conditions, or other rules for your customers governing each Offer. You represent and warrant that you will run your Offers in accordance with all Applicable Laws and that you have all necessary authority, rights, licenses, consents and permissions to run your Offers (including, without limitation, the rights to provide the Offer Materials to Uber). You will not use the Offers to make charitable donations. When providing any Offer (and using the Offer Tools), you agree that you are subject to any additional guidelines, rules, and terms and conditions posted by Uber, which are hereby incorporated by reference into these Promotion&nbsp;Terms.</p><h4><a id="_206ipza"></a><strong>3. Reporting and Offer Costs.</strong></h4><p>Uber will use good faith efforts to provide you with reasonable information regarding your Offers, which may include, without limitation, the amount you have spent on each Offer (“Offer Costs”) and the number of Items sold in connection with each Offer. Uber, in its sole discretion, may highlight Offers and/or the results of Offers in Uber Eats Marketing&nbsp;Materials.</p><h4><a id="_4k668n3"></a><strong>4. Fees.</strong></h4><p>In consideration for Merchant’s efforts in running an Offer and stimulating customer demand and user traction through the Uber Eats App, Merchant shall charge Uber a promotional services fee (the “Promotional Fee”) in the amount separately agreed upon for the relevant&nbsp;Offer.</p><p>For Items where an Offer has been applied as a discount to the Retail Price of the Item, Uber will charge you a Service Fee based on the sum of the discounted Retail Price and the Promotional Fee. If the Offer consists of a discount on the Marketplace or Aggregator Delivery Charge, the Service Fee will be calculated as described in your Agreement and will not change. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for Offer Costs and that Uber may deduct Offer Costs from your Item&nbsp;Revenue.</p><h4><a id="_2zbgiuw"></a><strong>5. Self-billing.</strong></h4><p>You hereby grant a mandate to Uber to issue invoices/credit notes to itself for any Promotional Fees charged by you under this agreement (“Self-billed Invoices”). Uber hereby accepts the mandate granted by you, provided that you have completed your invoice settings on Restaurant Manager and have provided all information required for the accurate calculation and preparation of the Self-billed Invoices. All Self-billed Invoices will be issued in PDF format only (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) and can be accessed and downloaded from Restaurant Manager. No Self-billed Invoices will be issued or sent in paper format. You agree to store and archive the Self-billed Invoices in accordance with Applicable&nbsp;Law.</p><p>You agree to keep your invoice settings up to date and agree to notify Uber immediately if you change your VAT registration number and/or update your VAT registration&nbsp;status.</p><p>You may dispute any Self-billed Invoice issued by Uber within a period not exceeding seven (7) days from the issuance date of such Self-billed Invoice. If no such dispute is raised during this seven day period, you are deemed to have validated the relevant Self-billed&nbsp;Invoice.</p><p>You hereby agree not to issue any other invoices for the Promotional Fee set out in this&nbsp;agreement.</p><h4><a id="_1egqt2p"></a><strong>6. Indemnity.</strong></h4><p>Merchant shall indemnify Uber, its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (the “Uber Parties”) against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including but not limited to any interest, penalties and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis and all other professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by the Uber Parties arising out of or in connection with: (a) any third party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a third party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights arising out of or in connection with any Offer run by the Merchant and use of the Offer Materials; and (b) any third party claim arising out of or in connection with the manufacture, production, distribution, handling, advertising, consumption or use of, or otherwise relating to, any Offer run by the Merchant, whether or not any claim arises during the Term of the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any approval by an Uber Party of any Offer or use of Offer Materials shall not affect this right of&nbsp;indemnification.</p><h4><a id="_3ygebqi"></a><strong>7. Other.</strong></h4><p>Uber may amend these Promotion Terms from time to time in its sole discretion, and such amendments will be effective thirty (30) days after Uber’s posting of an updated Promotion Terms at <a href="http://www.uber.com/">www.uber.com</a> or such updated Promotion Terms otherwise being made available to Merchant by Uber, including, for example, through Restaurant Manager. Merchant’s continued use of the Offer Tools after such updated Promotion Terms become effective constitutes Merchant’s consent to be bound by the updated Promotion Terms. Merchant has the right to terminate the Promotion Terms in the event that Merchant disagrees with the amendments made in any updated Promotion Terms. Uber reserves the right, at any time, temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Offer Tools or the ability for Merchant to provide Offers, with or without notice. You agree that neither Uber nor any of its affiliates shall be liable to you (or to any third party) for the Offer or the Offer Tools, including for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Offer or the Offer Tools or providing Merchant with the ability to provide Offers. Except as specifically amended by the Promotion Terms, the terms and conditions of the Agreement and any amendments thereto shall remain in full force and&nbsp;effect.</p><a

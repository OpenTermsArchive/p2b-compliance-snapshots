Booking.com reserves the right to edit or exclude any information on becoming aware that it is incorrect or incomplete or in violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. </p>
<p>2.1.2   The Accommodation represents and covenants that the Accommodation Information shall at all times be true, accurate and not misleading.

Rate parity does not apply in respect of rates intended for a closed user group ("closed user group" means a group with defined limitations where membership is not automatic and where: (i) consumers actively opt in to become a member, (ii) any online or mobile interface used by closed user group members is password protected, (iii) closed user group members have completed a customer profile, and (iv) the consumer to which the rate is offered or made available already made at least one prior booking as a member of the closed user group) provided that such rates are not (directly or indirectly) publicly (made) available. In the event that a closed user group rate is (directly or indirectly) publicly (made) available (by the Accommodation, a (direct/indirect) competitor of Booking.com or on any third party (platform) (including any (meta) search engine or price comparison website), Booking.com is entitled to rate parity for such rate.</p>
<p><u>Availability Parity</u> means that the Accommodation shall provide Booking.com with such availability (i.e. rooms available for booking at the Platform) that are at least as favourable as those provided to any competitor of Booking.com (which includes any online or offline reservation or booking agency or intermediary) and/or with any other (online or offline) third party that is a business partner of or in any other way related with or connected to the Accommodation.</p>
<p>2.2.2   The restrictions and conditions (including the room price) for rooms made available for reservation on the Booking.com Platform shall at all times be in accordance with Clause 2.2.1 and make sense for all parties involved (including consumers).</p>
<p>2.2.3   Booking.com shall be entitled to give a discount on the room price at its own costs up to the amount of the commission.</p>
<p>2.2.4   Within the spirit of this Agreement and subject at all times to the availability parity set out in Clause 2.2.1, the Accommodation is encouraged to provide Booking.com with fair access to all room types (including various policies and restrictions) and rates available during the term of the Agreement (during periods of low and high demand (including during fairs, congresses and special events)).</p>

<p><u>2.3 Commission</u></p>
<p>2.3.1   For each reservation made on the Platforms by a Guest for a Room, the Accommodation shall pay Booking.com a commission (the "<strong>Commission</strong>") calculated in accordance with Clause 2.3.2. Payment shall be made in accordance with Clause 2.4. </p>
<p>2.3.2   The aggregate Commission per reservation is equal to the multiple of (i) the number of nights stayed at the Accommodation by the Guest, (ii) the booked rate per room per night (including VAT, sales taxes and such other applicable national, governmental, provincial, state, municipal or local taxes or levies (the "<strong>Taxes</strong>")) and such other extra's, fees and surcharges which are included in the offered rate at the time of booking of the room by a Guest on the Platforms (such as breakfasts, meals (half-board or full-board), bicycle rental, late check outs/early check in fees, extra person charges, resort fees, roll-away beds, theatre tickets, service fees, etc.), (iii) the number of booked rooms by the Guest, and (iv) the relevant Commission percentage set out in the Agreement (plus VAT/taxes (if applicable)).</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Accommodation hereby agrees and acknowledges that in the event of payment of the room price by the Guest to the Accommodation in accordance with Clause 4.4 (Facilitated Payment), Booking.com shall calculate the Commission in the event of no-show or cancellation in accordance with Clause 4.4.8.</p>
<p>In all other events Commission will be charged in the event of:
<br/>(a) overbooking: at all times, irrespective of ((un)successful/waiver of) charged room price, and/or 
<br/>(b) a charged cancellation and/or charged no-show: Booking.com charges commission when a partner charges Guest room price and/or no show/cancellation fee for (chargeable) cancellations and/or no-shows.</p>
<p>The commission shall at all times be calculated in accordance with the confirmed booking.</p>
<p>Notice of any waiver of any room charge or (no-show/cancellation) fee in the event of no-show or charged cancellation, or notice of any invalid payment method for any no-show reservation or cancelled reservation, must at all times be made within 48 hours after midnight on the day following the scheduled date of check-out (example: checkout is 14:00 on March 1st, waiving must  happen before 23:59 hrs on March 3rd in Accommodation time zone). </p>
<p>Upon receiving the notification of waiver, Booking.com will inform the Guest accordingly and the Accommodation shall promptly process the refund (if applicable).</p>
<p>In the absence of any notification by the Accommodation to Booking.com (waiver, invalid credit card), Booking.com will assume that the Accommodation has successfully charged the Guest and Booking.com will charge commission accordingly. </p>
<p>2.3.3   Unless agreed otherwise in the Agreement, the rate shown to Guests on the Platforms shall be inclusive of VAT, sales tax, charges and all such other (national, governmental, provincial, state, municipal or local) taxes, fees, charges or levies (to the extent that such other taxes, fees and levies can be reasonably calculated upfront without further information).</p>
<p>2.3.4   In the event that pursuant to (amendment or entering into force of) the applicable law, rules and legislation applicable to the Accommodation, the rates must be shown to Guests inclusive of VAT, sales tax and all such other (national, governmental, provincial, state, municipal or local) taxes, fees or levies, the Accommodation shall adjust the rates through the Extranet in accordance with the terms of Clause 2.1.2 and 2.1.4 as soon as possible, but in any event within 5 business days after (i) amendment or entering into force of the relevant law, rules and legislation in this respect applicable to such Accommodation, or (ii) notification thereof by Booking.com.</p>
<p>2.3.5   The Extranet shows details of all reservations made at the Accommodation through the Platforms and the corresponding Commission. On the 1st day of each month, an online reservation statement (the "<strong>Online Reservation Statement</strong>") is available on the Extranet showing the reservations of all Guests whose date of departure fell in the previous month.</p>

<p><u>2.4 Payment Commission</u></p>
<p>2.4.1   Commission for bookings in a calendar month that contains the (scheduled) departure date of the Guest in such month will be invoiced (save for free cancellations made through Booking.com and in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Accommodation) and paid in the subsequent month in accordance with the following terms:</p>
<p>(a) Invoices are processed on a monthly basis and shall be sent to the Accommodation online or by mail, fax or e-mail (at the discretion of Booking.com). </p>
<p>(b) The Commission invoiced in respect of a month shall be paid by the Accommodation within 14 days from the invoice date.</p>

Booking.com may from time to time settle (the relevant part) of the invoice in accordance with Clause 4.4 for reservations of which the payment has been made in accordance with Clause 4.4. For the avoidance of doubt, other means of payment (such as by cheque or via "payment agencies") cannot be processed by Booking.com and therefore will not be accepted. The Accommodation shall bear all costs as charged by the banks for the transfer of the funds.</p>
<p>(d) All Commission payments to be made under this Agreement shall be made in cleared funds, without any deduction or set-off and free and clear of and without deduction for or on account of any taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges, fees and withholdings of any nature now or hereafter imposed by any governmental, fiscal or other authority. If the Accommodation is compelled to make any such deduction or withholding, it will pay to Booking.com such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt by Booking.com of the full (net) amount as set out in the invoice which Booking.com would have received but for the deduction. The Accommodation is responsible and liable for the payment and remittance of any taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges, fees and withholdings over and above the full (net) Commission payment due from the Accommodation to Booking.com.</p>
<p>(e) The commission invoiced in respect of a month shall be paid by the Accommodation in the relevant currency (and if applicable at the exchange rate) as specified in the invoice. Booking.com may at its sole discretion prepare invoices either in a major currency (e.g. EUR/USD) or the relevant local currency of the Accommodation and subsequently convert the relevant final amount in the local currency or a major currency on the basis of the exchange rate of the last day of the relevant month for which the invoice is issued (and not on the day of checkout). The exchange rate used shall be the interbank rate (closing rate as per 4PM EST) as used or promulgated by major international financial banks or service companies from time to time selected by Booking.com.</p>
<p>2.4.2   The Accommodation is responsible for withholding and reporting relevant taxes (i.e. mentioned above in 2.4.1 under d) applicable to the Commission due to Booking.com according to the relevant tax regulations and the practices and requests of the tax authorities. The Accommodation shall bear and be responsible for the payment and remittance of the taxes applicable to the Commission (payments) and the associated late payment interests and penalties imposed by the tax authority for failing to withhold and report any taxes applicable to the Commission. If required, the Accommodation shall be solely responsible to negotiate and agree with the relevant tax authorities on the tax treatments of the Commission (payments). The Accommodation shall upon first request of Booking.com provide Booking.com with (photo/scanned-) copies of tax payment certificates/tax exemption certificates upon each remittance of the Commission. The Accommodation represents and covenants that it is duly registered with all relevant tax authorities (including applicable statutory (local) revenue collection authorities) as a hotel or other accommodation provider. </p>
<p>2.4.3   In the event of a dispute between Booking.com and the Accommodation (e.g. on the amount of the Commission), any undisputed amount of the Commission will be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, notwithstanding the status or nature of the dispute.</p>
<p>2.4.4   In the case of late payment, Booking.com reserves the right to claim statutory interest, to suspend its service under the Agreement (e.g. by suspending the Accommodation from the Platforms), and/or to ask for a bank guarantee or other form of financial security from the Accommodation.</p>
<p>2.4.5   The Accommodation shall upon first request of Booking.com pay a deposit which amount shall be equal to minimum the sum of the 3 highest invoices of operations with Booking.com or such other amount as determined by Booking.com at its discretion (the "<strong>Deposit</strong>"). The Deposit will be held by Booking.com as a security for performance of the (payment) obligations of the Accommodation under the Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Deposit, or any balance thereof after deducting outstanding Commission, shortfall payments and other costs due to Booking.com will be repaid to the Accommodation within 30 days after settlement in full of the outstanding obligations and liabilities (including the payment of the outstanding Commission). Upon first request of Booking.com, the Accommodation shall pay as further Deposit such additional amount as requested by Booking.com if the outstanding Commission exceeds the Deposit or if the Accommodation frequently fails to pay the Commission when due. At any point during the term of the Agreement, Booking.com will monitor the (payment) performance of the Accommodation and may decide to repay the Deposit to the Accommodation after review (used criteria at Booking.com discretion).The amount of the Deposit shall in no way limit or cap the liability of the Accommodation under this Agreement. The Deposit shall not bear any interest. </p>

Booking.com is not responsible for the correctness and completeness of the information (including credit card details) and dates provided by Guests and Booking.com is not responsible for the payment obligations of the Guests relating to their (online) reservation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Accommodation shall on a regular basis (but at least on a daily basis) check and verify on the Extranet (the status of) the reservations made.</p>
<p>2.5.2   By making a reservation through the Platforms a direct contract (and therefore legal relationship) is created solely between the Accommodation and the Guest (the "<strong>Guest Reservation</strong>"). </p>
<p>2.5.3   The Accommodation is bound to accept a Guest as its contractual party, and to handle the online reservation in compliance with the Accommodation Information (including rate) contained on the Platforms at the time the reservation was made and the reservation confirmation, including any supplementary information and/or wishes made known by the Guest. </p>

<p>2.5.5   Complaints or claims in respect of (the products or service offered, rendered or provided by) the Accommodation or specific requests made by Guests are to be dealt with by the Accommodation, without mediation by or interference of Booking.com. Booking.com is not responsible for and disclaims any liability in respect of such claims from the Guests. Booking.com may at all times and at its sole discretion (a) offer customer (support) services to a Guest, (b) act as intermediate between the Accommodation and a Guest, (c) provide -at the costs and expenses of the Accommodation- alternative accommodation of an equal or better standard in the event of an overbooking or other material irregularities or complaints in respect of the Accommodation, or (d) otherwise assist a Guest in its communication with or actions against the Accommodation.</p>
<p>2.5.6   In the event of a valid claim of a Guest under the We Price Match, Booking.com shall promptly notify the Accommodation of such claim and provide the Accommodation with the relevant details of the claim. The Accommodation shall immediately adjust –to the extent applicable– the rate(s) made available at the Booking.com Platform such that the lower rate is available for further booking(s).  Furthermore, the Accommodation shall immediately adjust the rate in the reservation made by the relevant Guest in its administration. Upon check out of the Guest, the Accommodation shall offer the room for the lower rate and shall either (i) settle the difference between the booked rate and the lower rate by charging the Guest for the lower rate, or (ii) refund (in cash) to the Guest the difference between the two rates.</p>

<p><u>2.6 Overbooking and cancellation</u></p>
<p>2.6.1   The Accommodation shall provide the rooms booked and in the event that the Accommodation is not able to meet its obligations under this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, the Accommodation shall promptly inform Booking.com via Customer Service (customer.service@booking.com; whereas the subject line of each email shall state "overbooking"). Unless Booking.com has arranged for alternative accommodation (to be verified by the Accommodation with Booking.com), the Accommodation will use its best endeavours to procure alternative arrangements of equal or superior quality at the expense of the Accommodation and in the event that no Room is available on arrival, the Accommodation will:</p>
<p>(a) find suitable alternative accommodation of an equal or better standard to the Accommodation holding the Guest‘s guaranteed booking; </p>
<p>(b) provide free private transportation to the alternative accommodation for the Guest and other members of the Guest’s party who are listed in the Guest’s guaranteed booking, and</p>
<p>(c) reimburse and compensate Booking.com and/or the Guest for all reasonable costs and expenses (e.g. costs alternative accommodation, transportation, telephone costs) made, suffered, paid or incurred by the Guest and/or Booking.com due to or caused by the overbooking. Any amount charged by Booking.com in this respect shall be paid within 14 days after receipt of the invoice.</p>
<p>2.6.2   The Accommodation is not allowed to cancel any online reservation. </p>
<p>2.6.3   Cancellations made by Guests before the time and date beyond which a cancellation fee applies will not attract commission. Cancellations made by Guests after the time and date beyond which a cancellation fee applies will attract commission in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p><u>2.7 Credit Card guarantee</u></p>
<p>2.7.1   Save for reservations paid through Facilitated Payment (in which event this Clause 2.7 is not applicable), guarantee of the booking is based on the credit card details provided by the Guest or the person responsible for the booking. The Accommodation shall at all times accept all major credit cards (including Master Card, Visa and American Express) for guarantee of a booking. The Accommodation is responsible for the verification of the validity of these credit card details, the (pre) authorization of the credit card and the limit of credit on the date of the overnight stay(s) booked. The Accommodation shall upon receipt of a booking, promptly verify and pre-authorize the credit card. If the credit card offers no guarantee, the Accommodation will immediately notify Booking.com, which subsequently invites the Guest to guarantee the booking in an alternative manner. If the Guest is unable or unwilling to do this, Booking.com may cancel the booking upon request of the Accommodation. If the credit card (or any alternative guarantee made by the Guest) is not effective or valid for any reason, this shall always be at the risk and for the account of the Accommodation. Bookings which are cancelled by Booking.com pursuant to this Clause 2.7.1 will not attract any Commission.</p>
<p>2.7.2   The Accommodation which wishes to take payment from the credit card before the date of check-in must ensure that the up-front payment condition (including the (special) rate restrictions, terms and conditions for or connected with such pre-payment) are clearly explained to Guests in the information made available to the Guest prior to making a reservation and included in the Accommodation Information.</p>
<p>2.7.3   The Accommodation shall be responsible for charging the Guest for the consumed stay, no show fee or charged cancellation (including applicable Taxes for which the Accommodation shall be liable and remit to the relevant tax authorities). Credit cards shall be charged in the same currency as set out in the reservation of a Guest. To the extent that this is not possible, the Accommodation may charge the credit card of the Guest in a different currency with a reasonable and fair exchange rate.</p>
<p>2.7.4   In the event of offering rooms at cash payment only, no credit card details will be made available by Booking.com to the Accommodation (each a "<strong>Cash Only Accommodation</strong>" or "<strong>COA</strong>") as guarantee for the booking.</p>

<p><u>2.8 Data Privacy, Messaging and Usage</u></p>
<p>The Accommodation understands and agrees that the Booking.com Data Privacy and Messaging Guidelines apply and form an integral part of this Agreement. The Booking.com Data Privacy and Messaging Guidelines are set out in Annex 1.</p>

<p><u>2.9 Direct marketing to Guests</u></p>
<p>The Accommodation agrees not to specifically target Guests that have been obtained via Booking.com in either online or offline marketing promotions or solicited or unsolicited mail.</p>

<p><u>2.10 Force Majeure Event</u></p>
<p>In the event of a Force Majeure Event, the Accommodation shall not charge (and shall repay (if applicable)) the Guests affected by the Force Majeure Event any fee, costs, expenses or other amount (including the (non-refundable) rate or the no-show, (change of) reservation or cancellation fee) for (i) any cancellation or change of the reservation made by the Guests, or (ii) that part of the reservation that was not consumed, due to the Force Majeure Event. In the event of reasonable and justified doubt, the Accommodation may ask a Guest to provide reasonable evidence of the causality between the Force Majeure Event and cancellation, no-show or change of reservation (and provide Booking.com upon request with a copy of such evidence). In order for Booking.com to register any cancellation, no-show or amendment of the reservation due to a Force Majeure Event, the Accommodation shall inform Booking.com within 2 business days after (a) the scheduled check out date of the no-show or cancellation, or (b) check out, the number of days actually stayed. Booking.com will not charge any commission in the event of a registered no-show or cancellation or over that part of the booking which is not consumed due to the Force Majeure Event.</p>

<h4>3.  LICENSE</h4>
<p>3.1 The Accommodation hereby grants Booking.com a non-exclusive, royalty free and worldwide right and license (or sublicense as applicable):</p>
<p>(a) to use, reproduce, have reproduced, distribute, sublicense, communicate and make available in any method and display those agreed upon elements of the Intellectual Property Rights of the Accommodation as provided to Booking.com by the Accommodation pursuant to this Agreement and which are necessary for Booking.com to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this Agreement;</p>
<p>(b) to use, reproduce, have reproduced, process, distribute, sublicense, display and utilize (including without limitation to publicly perform, modify, adapt, communicate, reproduce, copy and make available to the public in any manner whatsoever) the Accommodation Information.</p>
<p>3.2 Booking.com may sublicense, make available, disclose and offer the Accommodation Information (including the relevant Intellectual Property Rights) of the Accommodation and special offers made available by the Accommodation on the Platforms and all such further rights and licenses set out in this Agreement via or in collaboration with (the websites, apps, platform, tools or other devices of) affiliated companies and/or third parties (the "<strong>Third Party Platforms</strong>"). </p>
<p>3.3 In no event shall Booking.com be liable to the Accommodation for any acts or omissions on the part of any Third Party Platforms. The sole remedy for the Accommodation in respect of such Third Party Platforms is (i) to request Booking.com (which has the right and not the obligation) to disable and disconnect with such Third Party Platform, or (ii) termination of this Agreement, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<h4>4.  RANKING, GUEST REVIEWS, MARKETING AND FACILITATED PAYMENT (AGENCY) MODEL</h4>
<p><u>4.1 Ranking</u></p>
<p>4.1.1   The order in which the Accommodation is listed on the Platforms (the "<strong>Ranking</strong>"), is determined automatically and unilaterally by Booking.com. Ranking is based on and influenced by various factors, including but not limited to the commission percentage (to be) paid by the Accommodation, the minimum availability stated by the Accommodation, the number of bookings related to the number of visits to the relevant accommodation page on the Platform (the "<strong>Conversion</strong>"), the volume realized by the Accommodation, the ratio of cancellations, the guest review scores, the customer service history, the number and type of complaints from Guests and the on-time payment record of the Accommodation.</p>
<p>4.1.2   The Accommodation has the possibility to influence its own ranking by changing the commission percentage and availability for certain periods, and continuously improving the other factors. The Accommodation shall not make any claim against Booking.com regarding the Ranking of Accommodation; the Ranking system is automated. The automated Ranking (as defined hereafter) system uses on-time payment as a factor so failure to pay Commissions on-time will result in a reduced Ranking.</p>

<p>4.2.6   The guest reviews are for exclusive use by Booking.com and can be made available on such Platforms as from time to time made available to by Booking.com. Booking.com exclusively retains ownership of all rights, title and interest in and to (all intellectual property rights of) the guest reviews and the Accommodation is not entitled to (directly or indirectly) publish, market, promote, copy, scrape, (hyper-/deep)link to, integrate, obtain, utilize, combine, share or otherwise use the guest reviews without prior written approval of Booking.com.</p>

<p>4.4.1   The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that Booking.com may (at all times as agent) – from time to time and in certain jurisdictions and for certain properties facilitate certain payment methods for the (pre-/down) payment of the Room Price (as defined below) by Guests to the Accommodation pursuant to which (as available) bank transfer, credit card payments or other forms of online payment can be made and processed for and on behalf of the Accommodation (by means of full and final settlement of payment) (the "<strong>Facilitated Payment</strong>"). Booking.com may from time to time engage a third party to facilitate and process the payment (the "<strong>Payment Processor</strong>").</p>
<p>4.4.2   The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that for each reservation, the relevant total amount of the reservation (including all applicable Taxes, fees, extra's and add-ons made or included during the reservation process (e.g. breakfast) to the extent disclosed to Booking.com by the Accommodation (unless indicated otherwise by Booking.com)) will be collected and processed by the Payment Processor (the relevant amount hereafter the "<strong>Room Price</strong>") in accordance with the applicable payment policy of the Accommodation for the relevant reservation and disclosed on the Platform. </p>
<p>4.4.3   The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that Booking.com may from time to time use and utilize the Facilitated Payment (including other (online) payment methods such as virtual credit cards) for ( i ) (pre-/down) payment of the Room Price by the Guest to the Accommodation through the Payment Processor in final settlement of such payment, and (ii) settlement and payment of (a) the due and outstanding Commission by setting off the due and outstanding Commissions for reservations that have been paid in accordance with Clause 4.4, and (b) such other amounts due by the Accommodation to Booking.com with the total amount of all the Room Prices processed at any time through the Payment Processor. Insofar there are insufficient funds to settle and pay all amounts due to Booking.com, Booking.com shall be entitled to collect the relevant deficit by means of Direct Debit (if available), set off with the Deposit (if applicable) or the Accommodation shall upon first request of Booking.com pay the relevant deficit to such bank account as from time to time identified by Booking.com. Booking.com is entitled to use the Facilitated Payment to settle and set off with any Commission due to Booking.com. </p>
<p>4.4.4   The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that it is –at all times– responsible for the collection, reporting, remittance, withholding and payment to the relevant (tax) authorities (as applicable) of the relevant Taxes, (sur)charges, extra's and fees over the Room Price (including the relevant Taxes, (sur)charges, extra's, amounts and fees not included in the Room Price) and remittance, withholding and payment (as applicable) of the Taxes over the Commission, to the relevant tax authorities. Unless Booking.com has indicated that certain Taxes, fees, charges add-ons (e.g. breakfast) or other amounts are not included Room Price (the "<strong>Excluded Elements</strong>"), the Accommodation shall not further charge, request payment of or collect any amount from the Guest that has not already been included in the Room Price (save for the Excluded Elements (if applicable)).</p>
<p>4.4.5   In order to transfer the relevant collected amount (after deducting and set-off (if applicable) with the due and outstanding Commissions (if permitted), fees, costs and expenses and such other amounts due to Booking.com) (the "<strong>Net Amount</strong>"), the Accommodation shall provide Booking.com with the relevant bank details to which the relevant amount shall be paid or be provided with a virtual credit card (the :"<strong>Virtual Card</strong>") to collect the relevant funds. The Virtual Card may be authorized or charged as per the date of reservation. For payment via bank transfer: Booking.com or the Payment Processor shall transfer the Net Amount to the Accommodation within 14 days after the end of the month in which the Guest is checked-out.

Payment of the Room Price may at all times without notice be suspended in the event of (alleged or suspected) (credit card) fraud or breach of contract. The Accommodation accepts and acknowledges that due to fluctuating currency exchange rates and costs/fees charged by banks, credit card companies and other intermediaries (for the collection, processing and paying the relevant funds), there may be differences between Room Price (as uploaded by the Accommodation in the system), the collected amount and the amount paid to the Accommodation. The Accommodation shall bear the currency exchange risk and the costs and fees as charged by its banks for the receipt and conversion of the Room Price. The funds held by the Payment Processor or any other party for and on behalf of the Accommodation will not bear any interest. The relevant funds on the Virtual Card shall be available for collection by the Accommodation for a period of 6 months after the date of check out.</p>
<p>4.4.6   In the event of (alleged) fraudulent activities by the Accommodation or if Booking.com is required by law, court order, (semi) governmental instruction or orders, arbitrational decision (or similar ruling), subpoena or cancellation policy to make a refund, of all or part of the Room Price (or insofar otherwise reasonable and fair), Booking.com reserves the right to claim from the Accommodation repayment of such amount (re)paid to Guest, but received by the Accommodation (which payment shall be made within 14 days after a request by Booking.com).</p>
<p>4.4.7   Insofar the Accommodation agrees to a refund of a wholly or partly paid non-refundable Room Price (or part thereof), Booking.com shall be entitled to settle on behalf of the Accommodation the relevant amount paid to the Guest with other amounts collected by the Payment Processor or – if requested by the Accommodation and approved by Booking.com – the relevant amount shall be paid and transferred to Booking.com within 14 days upon approval by Booking.com and Booking.com shall transfer the relevant amount to the Guest as soon as possible from an organisational and technical point of view as of the moment that the entitlement comes into existence legally and not charge the Accommodation any commission for such refund.</p>
<p>4.4.8   In the event of a no-show or cancellation, Booking.com shall be entitled to charge commission over the relevant amount of the room price collected and transferred to the Accommodation. In the event of an overbooking, the Commission shall be calculated in accordance with Clause 2.3.2.</p>
<p>4.4.9   The Accommodation shall <u>only issue an invoice to the Guest</u> (and provide such Guest upon his/her first request with an invoice) for the full amount of the reservation (including or plus (as required by applicable laws) of all applicable Taxes, surcharges and fees).

<p>1.2 Unless defined otherwise in these Guidelines, capitalized terms have the same meaning as set out in the Agreement.</p>

<p>2. Data Privacy</p>
<p>2.1 Each Party shall take reasonable steps to protect personal data (i.e., information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person) processed in the context of the Agreement against loss and unauthorized access, use, deletion and disclosure; and, as required by applicable laws, process personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate confidentiality and security of the personal data.</p>
<p>2.2 The Trip Provider acknowledges that it is responsible for the handling and security of the personal data it holds and processes within the context of the Agreement and Booking.com acknowledges that it is responsible for the handling and security of the personal data it processes within the context of the Agreement. Trip Provider shall provide personal data to Booking.com only if such disclosure is permitted under applicable laws. Booking.com shall be a data controller (i.e. determines the purposes and means of the data processing) for any personal data it processes. Trip Provider shall become data controller upon receipt of the personal data either directly or indirectly through a connectivity partner. Unless agreed otherwise, connectivity partners handle personal data on behalf of a Trip Provider. Each Party shall be solely responsible for the processing of personal data by itself or on its behalf in accordance with applicable data protection laws. The Parties shall, if required by applicable laws, cooperate in good faith and provide assistance in the event data subjects wish to exercise their rights of access, correction, erasure or portability, or in case of requests from competent authorities to demonstrate compliance with obligations applicable to the Party.</p>
<p>2.3 To the extent Booking.com processes personal data that is not Guest data in association with the Agreement, such personal data shall be processed by Booking.com in accordance with the Booking.com Privacy Statement applicable to Trip Providers, which can be found on www.booking.com. The Trip Provider warrants that it has, as required by applicable laws, duly and diligently informed (and as required by applicable laws, obtained consents from) its staff members, agents, representatives and other individuals about the processing of their personal data by Booking.com and the cross-border transfer of their personal data to countries that do not provide for adequate protection of rights of personal data subjects.</p>
<p>2.4 Trip Provider shall process personal data that Trip Provider received from Booking.com as part of the Services under the Agreement only so far as necessary to perform the requested reservation services, or as otherwise agreed to between the Parties in writing, in accordance with applicable law, including (if applicable) Directive 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC (as amended or replaced by subsequent legal acts) on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy or the EU General Data Protection Regulation or if Trip Provider has obtained explicit consent from the Guest to any other use of Guest’s personal data.</p>
<p>2.5 If the Trip Provider will or intends to notify Guests or other parties (e.g., competent data protection and/or government authorities) of a data breach (any discovered or suspected incident resulting in accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction of, loss of, alteration of, access to, disclosure of, or use of personal data) involving personal data received by the Trip Provider from Booking.com, and the notification will reference Booking.com, Trip Provider shall first, to the extent permitted by law, provide any draft notification and related correspondence to Booking.com and reasonably cooperate with Booking.com in finalizing such notification and correspondence and other communication that may follow with the Guests or authorities. Trip Provider acknowledges that Booking.com retains the right to voluntarily inform its users about any such data breach. For the avoidance of doubt, Trip Provider shall not notify Guests or other parties of a data breach involving personal data that Booking.com hosts on the Extranet (defined in 4.2) without prior written authorization from Booking.com.</p>
<p>2.6 In case the party contracting with Booking.com B.V. is not directly processing personal data of Guests under its own control (e.g. as may be applicable in case of chains, property management companies etc.), this Clause 2 shall be read to apply to the Trip Provider ultimately processing the personal data of Guests. In such case, either contracting party and/or Trip Provider may be considered the (sole) data controller of any Guest data processed in the context of the Agreement.</p>

<p>3. Messaging Tools</p>
<p>Booking.com may from time to time as part of its service to the Guest and Trip Provider facilitate the communication between the Guest and the Trip Provider (the "Messaging Service") using tools provided by Booking.com. Booking.com will process communications sent via the Messaging Service (the “Communications”) in accordance with the Booking.com Privacy and Cookies Statement applicable to Trip Providers available on www.booking.com. The Trip Provider hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees and consents to the processing of Communications by Booking.com (including any processing, storage, receipt, access, insight and screening of communications by Booking.com) and states that it has duly and diligently informed (and as required by applicable laws, obtained consent from) the Trip Provider’s employees, agents, representatives, staff members and other individuals of/for/when using the Communication Service for or on the Trip Provider’s behalf (including the processing, receipt, insight, storage, screening and access of such communications by Booking.com).</p>

<p>4. Use of Booking.com Online Services</p>
<p>4.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Trip Provider agrees to comply and have individuals acting on its behalf, comply with the Booking.com Business Partner Account Terms of Use, as made available on www.booking.com.</p>
<p>4.2 Booking.com may offer an extranet facility to the Trip Provider (the “Extranet”). The Trip Provider shall safeguard and keep the user ID and password confidential and secure, and shall not disclose the user ID and password to any person other than those who need to have access to the Extranet to fulfil their job responsibilities. The Trip Provider shall notify Booking.com at report@booking.com within 24 hours of any actual or suspected breach of security or confidentiality involving the user ID and password used to access the Booking.com Extranet.</p>
<p>4.3 The Trip Provider agrees not to use the Messaging Service to send unsolicited electronic communications to any individual. Trip Provider will fully indemnify Booking.com for any claims of third parties or fines resulting from unlawful or unauthorized use of the Messaging Service by Trip Provider for its own purposes.</p>

<p>5. Payment Card Security</p>
<p>To the extent the Trip Provider processes payment card information obtained by the Trip Provider through the Booking.com reservation services, the Trip Provider is required to comply and to have its service providers comply on an ongoing basis with the requirements, compliance criteria and validation processes set forth in the current Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard issued by the major credit card companies.</p>

The User Agreement constitutes a legally binding agreement between you and Viedit. This agreement is effective on March 1st , 2013 for all users. These terms and conditions apply to the services available from the domain and eventually sub-domains of viedit.com.

</p>
<p>
<strong>1. Viedit is an Independent Electronic Market Place (IEMP). Viedit is for instance not a Service Provider (SP) or broker.</strong>
Our site acts as an IEMP where Creators and Clients can meet and enter into agreements. We are not involved in the actual transaction between the Creators and Clients. As a result, we have no control over the quality, safety, or legal aspects of the transactions that take place on our website, unless explicitly stated otherwise hereunder. Viedit does not prequalify or validate the claims of each party including with respect to their qualifications, licensure, insurance and registration. We and our website function solely as an IEMP where two parties may agree on a price for a particular type of service. We are an IEMP for this connection between you and other members. We do not provide any endorsement for you or your services, you acknowledge and agree that we do not provide the services and we are not in any way responsible for assisting you in any manner with your provision of the services. We cannot and will not guarantee the ability of members to complete payment for any of the provided services. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of individual authentication, especially on the Internet, we cannot and will not in any manner verify or confirm the identity or ability of members to pay for the provided services. You acknowledge and agree that any and all communications, correspondence, verbal or written, or any warranties or representations, made with regard to the services are not provided by us and are specifically and solely between you and the other member. Because we are not involved in the actual transaction between Creators and Clients, we have no control for instance over the accuracy of listings, the ability of Creators to deliver the requested services. We cannot ensure that an Creator or Client will actually reach an agreement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Membership.</strong>
Our services are available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Our services are not available to minors or to temporarily or indefinitely suspended Viedit members. You acknowledge that you are at least 18 years of age. Minors may only use this service in conjunction with their parents or guardians. Your Viedit membership may not be transferred or sold to another party. If you are registering as a business entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind the entity to this agreement. Members who engage in the Editing of movies must have all skills and experience as well in case this is required by Law  valid license to render the services requested or intended. You agree that the website is for services only and that work that you provide will only involve services. You agree that you will not use your participation in the Viedit website as a means to sell or market any types of goods or products, unless specifically allowed by Viedit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Other Terms and Conditions.</strong>
We have the right to revise and amend these terms (including the terms  incorporated by reference) from time to time by email or other valid media or by posting the amended terms on this site. Except as stated elsewhere, all amended terms shall automatically be effective once they are posted. This User Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in writing hand signed by you and us. For the purposes of this provision, “in writing” does not include an email message and “hand signed” does not include an electronic signature. Once notice is given of any changes to these terms and conditions you can choose to cancel your registration without penalty before the new terms affect you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Fees regarding use of Viedit.com.</strong>
There are currently no fees to join Viedit and no required listing fees for Creators and/or Clients. We recommend that you not disclose your Viedit password or any account sensitive information to any third parties.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. Deposits &amp; Payments for services.</strong>
Clients will always pay in advance for the services to be rendered, unless explicitly stated otherwise . Viedit will act as a collector for these advanced payments of Clients. This will be done by escrow and Viedit will in that regard act as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) regarding these payments. Payments by Clients must be done via www.paymill.com. Payments to Creators will be done by bank transfer. Creator will be charged by Viedit for the transaction costs regarding the bank transfer. Viedit reserves the right to 1) freeze the payment to Creators and/or 2) to repay the fees to Clients  in case of poor services rendered to Clients and/or not fulfilling its obligations under this agreement.
</p>
<p>
If, for any reason, any fees have not been received by Viedit (&quot;Unpaid Fees&quot;), the party that has not paid agrees to pay such Unpaid Fees immediately. Viedit may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 8% a year. This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest together with the overdue amount. Any partial payments made to members’ account balances will first be applied to the most recent fees owed us. If anytime after 30 days we cannot collect any fees owed to us, we may suspend or terminate your account. Viedit reserves the right to waive or change our fees, penalties, or interest at any time. Viedit also reserves the right to prevent you from changing your transactional currency until you have paid all Unpaid Fees. You also agree to pay any attorney fees, and other costs of collection incurred by us with respect to any Unpaid Fees. You also consent and authorize us to in our sole discretion make appropriate reports to 3rd party credit collection agencies, credit reporting agencies, financial institutions, tax agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>6. Cancellations.</strong>
As a principle Cancellation by Creators and/or Clients AFTER the offer of a Client has been accepted by an Creator is not possible unless this is in conflict with Dutch mandatory legal provisions. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>7. No Agency.</strong>
You hereby agree and acknowledge that your execution of this Agreement, your provision of services and/or your use of the Viedit website, does not confer or imply any contractor (independent or otherwise), agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship with us and furthermore that no affiliation, association or connection exists between you and us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>8. Release - process.</strong>
It is the sole responsibility of Client to determine all requirements (wishes and demands) regarding the services to be provided by Creator regarding the deliverables and thus to select an Creator explicitly or implicitly (by choice or randomly if Client choose that option in which latter situation Viedit will automatically invite an Creator). Creator accepts the offer as it is laid down by Client . Except in the situation Creator asks Client in depth further questions regarding the deliverables Creator is allowed to do so. Creator has freedom to act regarding such outcome in view of the questions although Creator is in principle only obligated, unless agreed upon otherwise regarding the outcome of the question(s), to perform the initial agreed upon services. The request for a proposal by Client regarding the deliverables will only be shown to the Creator(s)  that Client has chosen for whether explicitly or implicitly. Client is aware of the fact during the period an agreement between Client and Creator has not been reached and although the Raw material (such as photo, audio and movie) are not downloadable with the special tools it is however technically possible that Creators who are invited to accept might copy whole or parts of the Raw material that Client provided to accept a proposal from Creator(s). The Raw material however might be labelled with a reference (for instance a sound, a banner, a digital watermark) in order to prevent this as much as reasonably possible. Only when Client has reached an agreement with an Creator the material will be downloadable by Creator in order to perform the services agreed upon with Client. After the services have been performed satisfactorily and Client has accepted the Finished Movie all Raw material received and developed by Creator for and on behalf of Client will be deleted by Viedit from the Viedit website. The Product (i.e. the ordered and Finished Movie) will be made available to Client to download and/or share. Only if Client explicitly agrees to this the Finished Movie can be shown publicly on the Viedit website. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>9. Execution.</strong>
As Creator and/or Client, you are obligated to execute and complete the transaction of the agreement reached by you unless the transaction is prohibited by law or by this Agreement.
<strong style='font-style:italic'>
IMPORTANT: Viedit does not screen or qualify parties for compliance, skills etc. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, statutes and regulations regarding the website and any transactions conducted on or through the website. It is recommended that you confirm such compliance, skills directly with the other party before services are rendered by the other party.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>10. Creator.</strong>
You must legally be able to deliver the deliveries that you offer for. You agree that it is your sole obligation to comply with all laws, rules, statutes and regulations that may apply including any and all local, national and European requirements. You must describe your offer and all terms of your services through the form on our site. You acknowledge that the Viedit website exists for members to make a fully informed decision about your services offering, policies and procedures. Therefore, you shall disclose to every member that you attempt to do business with your services offerings and relevant policies, procedures and fees that you will charge, including, but not limited to, taxes and/or other service charges. In the event, that you charge &quot;extra fees&quot; (and we are made aware of this fact), Viedit reserves the right to suspend or cancel your account at our sole discretion. Your offer may only include content relevant to the description of your transportation services. If you offer on any request and your performance is accepted by Client, you are obligated to perform the services offered at the accepted price. You authorize Viedit to charge the Viedit commission fee when Client accepts your offer (see article 5). 
</p>
<p>
As Creator you guarantee and hereby declare that all information and data on your profile (including age, skills, experience, preferences et cetera) are correct, complete and consistent.
</p>
<p>
As Creator you are obligated to treat all information received from Client strictly confidential and hence will not be allowed to disclose this information without permission of Client. Furthermore Creator is obligated to remove all Raw material including the Finished Movie after the services have been performed. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>11. Third party services and/or tooling.</strong>
Viedit in acting as a IEMP will or may use the services of third parties and/or is depending on third parties for such services as storage, availability and payments (such as paypal.com; www.amazon.com; filestack.com etc). Viedit uses or might use tools from third parties. In any such case Viedit If and to the extent that Viedit supplies or makes third-party products (which term for the purpose of this provision also includes services and/or software) available to Client and/or Creator, the terms &amp; conditions of these third parties will apply in relation to these products/services, replacing that stipulated in the agreement if they are more favourable for Viedit. Parties accepts these third-party terms &amp; conditions and Viedit will send parties a copy of these on request.  Viedits liability for third-party products/services will under no circumstances be higher than that which can be recovered from the third party/third parties concerned.

<strong>13. Fraud.</strong>
Viedit may suspend or terminate your account if we suspect that you have engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with our website. Members may not manipulate the quote prices for any shipment or interfere with other members&#39; listings or transactions. Other fraudulent acts include:
</p>
<p>
<strong>A. Fees - You shall NOT:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Request payment from another Viedit member via instant cash transfer services (non-bank, point-to-point cash transfer services such as Western Union or Moneygram);</li>
<li>Charge to, or in any way attempt to collect from members, as an additional charge to the total amount agreed upon for the services, the Viedit Fee, or;</li>
<li>Charge members a higher price (including taxes, service charges, or any other fees) than that which was agreed upon on the Viedit website (given that the particulars of the service requested are materially the same as those requested on the Viedit website). Your accepted quote price must include ANY and ALL charges, including any taxes, fees, etc.;</li>
<li>Cause another person or entity to engage in any conduct, act or behaviour intended or designed to circumvent or avoid, in any manner, our right to the Fee;</li>
<li>Enter into any transaction, letter of intent or memorandum of understanding, written or verbal, formal or informal agreement, with a member, that circumvents or avoids our right to a Fee;</li>
<li>Communicate or correspond, whether by written, verbal, or electronic means, with a member, for the purpose of entering into an agreement or transaction that circumvents or avoids our right to a Match Fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>B. Manipulating feedback -</strong>
You acknowledge and agree that the Viedit website is a neutral venue and that all transactions for services are made by and between you and other members only and, therefore, we cannot, do not and will not make any comments on behalf of you or your services. As a consequence, you acknowledge that the key component and integrity of the website is the ability of members to leave feedback about you and/or your services (whether positive, neutral or negative) AND for other members to read and evaluate those feedback reviews and make voluntary choices based upon that feedback. Therefore, in order to preserve the key component and integrity of the website, you shall NOT:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Request payment from another Viedit member via instant cash transfer services (non-bank, point-to-point cash transfer services such as Western Union or Moneygram);</li>
<li>Charge to, or in any way attempt to collect from members, as an additional charge to the total amount agreed upon for the services, the Viedit Fee, or;</li>
<li>Charge members a higher price (including taxes, service charges, or any other fees) than that which was agreed upon on the Viedit website (given that the particulars of the service requested are materially the same as those requested on the Viedit website). Your accepted quote price must include ANY and ALL charges, including any taxes, fees, etc.;</li>
<li>Cause another person or entity to engage in any conduct, act or behaviour intended or designed to circumvent or avoid, in any manner, our right to the Fee;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>14. Off-Site Communications.</strong>
Viedit prohibits offers by its members to outside of the Viedit site. Offers of this nature circumvent Viedit’s fee structure and are a potential fraud risk for both Clients and Creators. Some examples of off-site offers include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Entering personal contact information, such as website addresses, fax numbers, phone numbers or email addresses, in Viedit’s question and answer system, profile section, &quot;Additional Information&quot; sections, username, discussion forums, shipment listing, or shipment description.</li>

</p>
<p>
<strong>16. Right to Reject or Remove Members.</strong>

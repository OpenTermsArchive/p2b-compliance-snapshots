But if we can’t work it out, then you and Reverb (including our employees, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) agree to submit our disputes exclusively to binding individual arbitration, and we won’t sue each other in court before a judge or jury, except in limited circumstances.

Informal Dispute Resolution.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\nBefore either side files an arbitration, you and Reverb will try in good faith to resolve our differences. To start the process, you must send an individualized written notice (“Notice of Dispute”) to Reverb at legal@reverb.com with your name and the email address registered to your Reverb account, and (2) a description of the Dispute and how you’d like it resolved. If Reverb has a Dispute with you, we will send that same information to the email address for your account. The parties then have 30 days to investigate claims and try to resolve the Dispute, and neither side can file an arbitration during that time.\\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eD. Arbitration Rules and Procedures. \\u003c/strong\\u003eThe next step, if we can’t resolve our Dispute, is for either side to submit an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You may serve Reverb with any arbitration demand by email to legal@reverb.com or certified mail to Reverb.com, LLC, 3345 N Lincoln, Chicago, IL 60657. If Reverb has a Dispute with you, we’ll send an arbitration demand to your email address. If for any reason the AAA can’t or won’t administer the arbitration, we’ll work together to select another provider (and if we can’t agree, a court will decide).\\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe arbitration will be held in English by a single arbitrator, and the arbitration hearing (if any) will be held by videoconference, unless the arbitrator decides otherwise. Any in-person hearing will be held in the county where you live, except in a Batch Arbitration (discussed below).  \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe arbitration will be decided, as applicable, under the \\u003ca href=\\\&quot;https://adr.org/Rules\\\&quot;\\u003eAAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules\\u003c/a\\u003e  or \\u003ca href=\\\&quot;https://adr.org/Rules\\\&quot;\\u003eCommercial Arbitration Rules,\\u003c/a\\u003e in each case as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. As in court, the arbitrator will apply governing law (including fee-shifting rules, time-based defenses, and offers of judgment), and has authority to impose sanctions pursuant to the AAA Rules, Rule 11, or other applicable law. The AAA Rules will govern the payment of all filing, case-management, administrative, hearing, and arbitrator fees (“Arbitration Fees”). \\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all issues, except that a court has exclusive authority to decide issues related to (1) the arbitrability of any claim or dispute, and (2) the enforceability of any part of this Arbitration Agreement. Except as provided in Section 6.E, the arbitrator can award relief only in favor of the individual claimant, and only as warranted by the claimant’s individual claim(s). The arbitrator will not be bound by decisions reached in other arbitrations. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on you and Reverb. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eE. Batch Arbitration.\\u003c/strong\\u003eTo ensure efficient resolution, if within a 90-day period, 15 or more claimants submit Notices of Dispute or file arbitrations with similar claims (i.e., with the same or similar facts and legal issues) and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, the disputes must be arbitrated in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”). Specifically, upon notice from either side, the AAA shall group the demands into : (1) a single Batch (if there are 15-50 claimants) or (2) Batches of 50 claimants each, with a smaller, final Batch consisting of any remaining claimants (if there are more than 50 claimants).  The AAA shall thereafter provide for the resolution of each Batch as a single consolidated  arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA, one set of Arbitration Fees, and one hearing (if any) per Batch to be held by videoconference (or in a place decided by the arbitrator). The parties will cooperate in good faith to implement this process and minimize the time and costs of arbitration.   Any challenge to the administrative determinations by AAA shall be heard by a single process arbitrator.  If this Section 6.E is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, then it shall be severed as to that claimant or Batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eF.

We’ll refer to this section as the “Arbitration Agreement,” and it applies wherever legally enforceable.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eA. Disputes We’ll Arbitrate.\\u003c/strong\\u003eYou and Reverb agree to mandatory individual arbitration for all claims arising from or relating to the Services, these and prior versions of the Terms of Use, any products, data, or content bought or sold, offered, accessed, displayed, transmitted or listed through the Services, and any actions or statements by Reverb or its users, in each case including any disputes that arose before the effective date of these Terms of Use (each, a “Dispute”). The exception is that we each may (1) bring individual claims in “small claims” court, and (2) seek injunctive relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eB. Class and Representative Action Waiver. \\u003c/strong\\u003e  You and Reverb agree that we each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis, and not on a class, representative, or collective basis. Except as provided in Section 6.E, disputes between us can’t be consolidated with those of any other person or entity. If a court decides that any part of this Section 6.B can’t be enforced for a particular claim or request for relief (e.g., public injunctive relief), then that particular claim or request shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in court. \\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eC. Informal Dispute Resolution.\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\nBefore either side files an arbitration, you and Reverb will try in good faith to resolve our differences. To start the process, you must send an individualized written notice (“Notice of Dispute”) to Reverb at legal@reverb.com with your name and the email address registered to your Reverb account, and (2) a description of the Dispute and how you’d like it resolved. If Reverb has a Dispute with you, we will send that same information to the email address for your account. The parties then have 30 days to investigate claims and try to resolve the Dispute, and neither side can file an arbitration during that time.\\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eD. Arbitration Rules and Procedures. \\u003c/strong\\u003eThe next step, if we can’t resolve our Dispute, is for either side to submit an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You may serve Reverb with any arbitration demand by email to legal@reverb.com or certified mail to Reverb.com, LLC, 3345 N Lincoln, Chicago, IL 60657. If Reverb has a Dispute with you, we’ll send an arbitration demand to your email address. If for any reason the AAA can’t or won’t administer the arbitration, we’ll work together to select another provider (and if we can’t agree, a court will decide).\\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe arbitration will be held in English by a single arbitrator, and the arbitration hearing (if any) will be held by videoconference, unless the arbitrator decides otherwise. Any in-person hearing will be held in the county where you live, except in a Batch Arbitration (discussed below).  \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe arbitration will be decided, as applicable, under the \\u003ca href=\\\&quot;https://adr.org/Rules\\\&quot;\\u003eAAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules\\u003c/a\\u003e  or \\u003ca href=\\\&quot;https://adr.org/Rules\\\&quot;\\u003eCommercial Arbitration Rules,\\u003c/a\\u003e in each case as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. As in court, the arbitrator will apply governing law (including fee-shifting rules, time-based defenses, and offers of judgment), and has authority to impose sanctions pursuant to the AAA Rules, Rule 11, or other applicable law. The AAA Rules will govern the payment of all filing, case-management, administrative, hearing, and arbitrator fees (“Arbitration Fees”). \\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all issues, except that a court has exclusive authority to decide issues related to (1) the arbitrability of any claim or dispute, and (2) the enforceability of any part of this Arbitration Agreement. Except as provided in Section 6.E, the arbitrator can award relief only in favor of the individual claimant, and only as warranted by the claimant’s individual claim(s). The arbitrator will not be bound by decisions reached in other arbitrations. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on you and Reverb. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eE. Batch Arbitration.\\u003c/strong\\u003eTo ensure efficient resolution, if within a 90-day period, 15 or more claimants submit Notices of Dispute or file arbitrations with similar claims (i.e., with the same or similar facts and legal issues) and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, the disputes must be arbitrated in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”). Specifically, upon notice from either side, the AAA shall group the demands into : (1) a single Batch (if there are 15-50 claimants) or (2) Batches of 50 claimants each, with a smaller, final Batch consisting of any remaining claimants (if there are more than 50 claimants).  The AAA shall thereafter provide for the resolution of each Batch as a single consolidated  arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA, one set of Arbitration Fees, and one hearing (if any) per Batch to be held by videoconference (or in a place decided by the arbitrator). The parties will cooperate in good faith to implement this process and minimize the time and costs of arbitration.   Any challenge to the administrative determinations by AAA shall be heard by a single process arbitrator.  If this Section 6.E is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, then it shall be severed as to that claimant or Batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eF. Opt out.\\u003c/strong\\u003eIf you are a new user of our Services, you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days after you first accept the Terms of Use. If you are an existing user of our Services, you can opt out within 30 days after this version of the Terms of Use becomes effective. To opt out, you must send a timely email to legal@reverb.com with your name, the email address registered to your Reverb account, the subject matter line “Arbitration Agreement Opt-Out,” and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration. If you validly opt out, the balance of the Terms of Use (and any other agreements between us) will otherwise apply to you. If we update the Terms of Use in the future, please note that won’t give you a new chance to opt out of arbitration.\\n\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\nIf you are an individual consumer, you may be entitled to invoke the mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence, and/or to bring legal proceedings in the courts of that country.

Accordingly, by selling and shipping an instrument internationally, you acknowledge that Reverb has informed you of the potential prohibitions set forth in CITES. \\u0026nbsp;AS SUCH, YOU AGREE TO ACCEPT AND ASSUME ANY AND ALL RISKS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL LOSS, INJURY, DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION OR CONFISCATION OF YOUR PROPERTY DUE TO VIOLATIONS OF CITES. \\u0026nbsp;YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS PROVISION AND HEREBY RELEASE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST REVERB RELATED TO FINANCIAL LOSS, INJURY, DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION OR CONFISCATION OF YOUR PROPERTY DUE TO VIOLATIONS OF CITES AND AGREED TO HOLD REVERB AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS HARMLESS AGAINST ANY SUCH CLAIMS. \\u0026nbsp;YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A COMPLETE RELEASE OF LIABILITY AGAINST REVERB.COM WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH CITES. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\\&quot;offset-anchor-wrapper\\\&quot;\\u003e\\n    \\u003ca id=\\\&quot;Indemnity\\\&quot;\\u003e\\n    \\u003c/a\\u003e\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2 class=\\\&quot;size-150 pb-2\\\&quot;\\u003e16.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. Copyright law. Additional laws apply to trademark rights and other types of rights in the U.S. and worldwide. You may not post, distribute, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information without obtaining all necessary prior written consents of the owner(s) of such proprietary rights.

The removed material may be replaced or access to it may be restored 10 business days after the counter notice is processed, unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order restraining the allegedly infringing party from relisting the items or a qualifying action with the Copyright Claims Board (CCB), and informs Reverb of this action.

<p>Joining and setting up a shop on Reverb is free. Reverb does not charge fees to list an item for sale. Reverb does charge a percentage of the sale price when the item sells. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/page/service-fee-2020">Reverb’s Billing Policy</a>, which is subject to change, is incorporated into these Terms of Use  by reference. Changes to the Billing Policy and the fees for Reverb's services are effective immediately after posting the changes on the Site to the fullest extent permitted by law, or otherwise immediately after the minimum period permitted by law. Reverb may also choose to temporarily change the Billing Policy and the fees for Reverb's services for promotional events (for example, free selling days); such changes are effective when Reverb posts the temporary promotional event on the Site or otherwise notifies you of the change. </p>
<p><strong>Fees and Termination:</strong>&nbsp;If Reverb terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Reverb fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Reverb for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel).&nbsp;<strong>YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT REVERB MAY CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD, OR ANY OTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT, ON FILE FOR ANY AND ALL OUTSTANDING OR DELINQUENT FEES OR BALANCES AND WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST REVERB FOR EXERCISING THIS RIGHT (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, USING YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION TO AID IN COLLECTING PAYMENT).&nbsp;</strong>If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact Reverb.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/page/service-fee-2020">Read About Reverb’s Billing Policy</a></p>

<h2 class="size-150 pb-2">6. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement</h2><br>
<div class="offset-anchor-wrapper">
    <a id="JAMS">
    </a>
</div>
<p>If you’re upset with us, let us know, and we’ll work together in good faith to resolve your issue. But if we can’t work it out, then you and Reverb (including our employees, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) agree to submit our disputes exclusively to binding individual arbitration, and we won’t sue each other in court before a judge or jury, except in limited circumstances. We’ll refer to this section as the “Arbitration Agreement,” and it applies wherever legally enforceable.</p>

<p><strong>A. Disputes We’ll Arbitrate.</strong>You and Reverb agree to mandatory individual arbitration for all claims arising from or relating to the Services, these and prior versions of the Terms of Use, any products, data, or content bought or sold, offered, accessed, displayed, transmitted or listed through the Services, and any actions or statements by Reverb or its users, in each case including any disputes that arose before the effective date of these Terms of Use (each, a “Dispute”). The exception is that we each may (1) bring individual claims in “small claims” court, and (2) seek injunctive relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights. </p>

<p><strong>B. Class and Representative Action Waiver. </strong>  You and Reverb agree that we each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis, and not on a class, representative, or collective basis. Except as provided in Section 6.E, disputes between us can’t be consolidated with those of any other person or entity. If a court decides that any part of this Section 6.B can’t be enforced for a particular claim or request for relief (e.g., public injunctive relief), then that particular claim or request shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in court. 
</p>

<p><strong>C. Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>
Before either side files an arbitration, you and Reverb will try in good faith to resolve our differences. To start the process, you must send an individualized written notice (“Notice of Dispute”) to Reverb at legal@reverb.com with your name and the email address registered to your Reverb account, and (2) a description of the Dispute and how you’d like it resolved. If Reverb has a Dispute with you, we will send that same information to the email address for your account. The parties then have 30 days to investigate claims and try to resolve the Dispute, and neither side can file an arbitration during that time.
</p>

<p><strong>D. Arbitration Rules and Procedures. </strong>The next step, if we can’t resolve our Dispute, is for either side to submit an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You may serve Reverb with any arbitration demand by email to legal@reverb.com or certified mail to Reverb.com, LLC, 3345 N Lincoln, Chicago, IL 60657. If Reverb has a Dispute with you, we’ll send an arbitration demand to your email address. If for any reason the AAA can’t or won’t administer the arbitration, we’ll work together to select another provider (and if we can’t agree, a court will decide).
</p>

<p>The arbitration will be held in English by a single arbitrator, and the arbitration hearing (if any) will be held by videoconference, unless the arbitrator decides otherwise. Any in-person hearing will be held in the county where you live, except in a Batch Arbitration (discussed below).  </p>

<p>The arbitration will be decided, as applicable, under the <a href="https://adr.org/Rules">AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules</a>  or <a href="https://adr.org/Rules">Commercial Arbitration Rules,</a> in each case as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. As in court, the arbitrator will apply governing law (including fee-shifting rules, time-based defenses, and offers of judgment), and has authority to impose sanctions pursuant to the AAA Rules, Rule 11, or other applicable law. The AAA Rules will govern the payment of all filing, case-management, administrative, hearing, and arbitrator fees (“Arbitration Fees”). 
</p>

<p>The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all issues, except that a court has exclusive authority to decide issues related to (1) the arbitrability of any claim or dispute, and (2) the enforceability of any part of this Arbitration Agreement. Except as provided in Section 6.E, the arbitrator can award relief only in favor of the individual claimant, and only as warranted by the claimant’s individual claim(s). The arbitrator will not be bound by decisions reached in other arbitrations. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on you and Reverb. </p>

<p><strong>E. Batch Arbitration.</strong>To ensure efficient resolution, if within a 90-day period, 15 or more claimants submit Notices of Dispute or file arbitrations with similar claims (i.e., with the same or similar facts and legal issues) and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, the disputes must be arbitrated in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”). Specifically, upon notice from either side, the AAA shall group the demands into : (1) a single Batch (if there are 15-50 claimants) or (2) Batches of 50 claimants each, with a smaller, final Batch consisting of any remaining claimants (if there are more than 50 claimants).  The AAA shall thereafter provide for the resolution of each Batch as a single consolidated  arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA, one set of Arbitration Fees, and one hearing (if any) per Batch to be held by videoconference (or in a place decided by the arbitrator). The parties will cooperate in good faith to implement this process and minimize the time and costs of arbitration.   Any challenge to the administrative determinations by AAA shall be heard by a single process arbitrator.  If this Section 6.E is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, then it shall be severed as to that claimant or Batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings.</p>

If you are an individual consumer, you may be entitled to invoke the mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence, and/or to bring legal proceedings in the courts of that country. If Reverb needs to enforce its rights against you as an individual consumer, we will do so only in your country of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded.  If a dispute arises between you and Reverb, we encourage you to contact Reverb customer support <a href="https://reverb.com/page/contact">here</a> to seek a resolution, and/or to follow the Informal Dispute Resolution process outlined in Section 6.C above. For EU sellers, you may view information about the Platform-to-Business (“P2B”) Regulation <a href="https://help.reverb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052412213-European-Union-P2B-platform-to-business-regulation-on-Reverb">here,</a> and you may raise a concern related to P2B  <a href="https://reverb.com/page/contact">here.</a> For EU sellers, if any dispute arises in connection with these Terms of Use, the parties should first try to resolve the dispute through the complaints procedure published <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&lng=EN">here.</a> In addition, the dispute may be referred by either party to the <a href="https://www.cedr.com/">Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“CEDR”)</a> for mediation. The Parties agree to enter into mediation to settle a good faith dispute and will do so in accordance with the CEDR’s mediation procedures. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of notice of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by CEDR. To initiate the mediation a party must give notice in writing to the other party to the dispute, referring the dispute to mediation. A copy of the referral should be sent to CEDR.</p>

<p>Reverb takes intellectual property infringement very seriously. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. Copyright law. Additional laws apply to trademark rights and other types of rights in the U.S. and worldwide. You may not post, distribute, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information without obtaining all necessary prior written consents of the owner(s) of such proprietary rights. If you do so repeatedly on the Site, you will be removed as a user. Without limiting the foregoing, if content that you own or have rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want it removed, please follow the steps listed in our&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://reverb.com/legal/reverbcom-Intellectual-Property-Policy">Intellectual Property Policy</a>. </p>

<p>In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Etsy accepts counter notices for US-based copyright infringement reports only. When Reverb receives a DMCA counter notice, we will provide a copy of the counter notice to the original complaining party. The removed material may be replaced or access to it may be restored 10 business days after the counter notice is processed, unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order restraining the allegedly infringing party from relisting the items or a qualifying action with the Copyright Claims Board (CCB), and informs Reverb of this action.

In addition, you shall be responsible for paying any and all taxes applicable to any purchases or sales of items you make on the Site (excluding any taxes on Reverb's net income). This includes sales and/or use taxes applicable in each jurisdiction, depending on the threshold required for collection. This responsibility may include applicable customs and fees for import and export sales; Reverb assumes no responsibility for any losses, fees, or confiscations related to importing and exporting products purchased through Reverb. <br> <br>Depending on your business status and location, Reverb may be required to apply VAT on seller fees and remit it to the relevant tax authority (some countries may refer to VAT as Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) or Harmonized Sales Tax (“HST”); VAT, GST, HST, and any local sales tax are collectively referred to as VAT). VAT is collected on all Reverb fees for sellers located in countries where VAT should be applied.
<br>
Internal Revenue Service regulations require that we file a Form 1099-K to report unadjusted annual gross sales information for sellers located in the United States or being paid in USD in certain circumstances.To comply with these regulations, sellers will be required to provide taxpayer-identification information to Reverb. Reverb is not responsible, in any manner, for paying taxes on your earnings or your use of the Site. Reverb cannot provide tax advice.

<h2 class="size-150 pb-2">24. Proposition 65 - California</h2><br>

<p>The California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Prop 65”) requires manufacturers, producers, packagers, importers, suppliers or distributors (the “Notice Parties”) of products to provide warnings to California consumers about potentially hazardous or cancer-causing materials in those products. &nbsp;Notice Parties are encouraged to include a warning that lists the specific chemicals in the product(s) if they are present in an amount that may be hazardous. Example warnings could read:</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals, including [name of chemical], which is/are known to the State of California to cause cancer. For more information, go to&nbsp;www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals, including [name of chemical], which is/are known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. For more information, go to&nbsp;www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.</strong></p>

<p>We encourage all Reverb users who sell to California residents to investigate the requirements and to make&nbsp;independent determinations about whether warnings are necessary when selling items to California residents. &nbsp;You can include warnings in your item descriptions on Reverb.  You agree to indemnify and hold Reverb harmless for any violations of Prop 65 or any claims arising out of your violation of Prop 65.</p> &nbsp;

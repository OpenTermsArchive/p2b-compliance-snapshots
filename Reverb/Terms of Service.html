Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in Cook County, Illinois, using the English language administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \\\&quot;AAA Rules\\\&quot;) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find the AAA Rules here), unless otherwise required by law. **Arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the dispute, will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules, and in the case of CEDR, its rules.\\u003cbr\\u003e\\nFor EU sellers, if any dispute arises in connection with these Terms of Use, the parties should first try to resolve the dispute through the complaints procedure published here. In addition, the dispute may be referred by either party to the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“CEDR”) for mediation. The Parties agree to enter into mediation to settle a good faith dispute and will do so in accordance with the CEDR’s mediation procedures. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of notice of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by CEDR. To initiate the mediation a party must give notice in writing to the other party to the dispute, referring the dispute to mediation. A copy of the referral should be sent to CEDR. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cdiv class=\\\&quot;offset-anchor-wrapper\\\&quot;\\u003e\\n\\t\\u003ca id=\\\&quot;ClassAction\\\&quot;\\u003e\\n\\t\\u003c/a\\u003e\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n \\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e(B) Class Action and Collective Action Waiver: The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this Agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding.

Reverb may also choose to temporarily change the Billing Policy and the fees for Reverb's services for promotional events (for example, free selling days); such changes are effective when Reverb posts the temporary promotional event on the Site or otherwise notifies you of the change. </p>
<p><strong>Fees and Termination:</strong>&nbsp;If Reverb terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Reverb fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Reverb for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel).&nbsp;<strong>YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT REVERB MAY CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD, OR ANY OTHER METHOD OF PAYMENT, ON FILE FOR ANY AND ALL OUTSTANDING OR DELINQUENT FEES OR BALANCES AND WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST REVERB FOR EXERCISING THIS RIGHT (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, USING YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION TO AID IN COLLECTING PAYMENT).&nbsp;</strong>If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact Reverb.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/page/service-fee-2020">Read About Reverb’s Billing Policy</a></p>

<div class="offset-anchor-wrapper">
    <a id="JAMS">
    </a>
</div>
<p><strong>(A) Arbitration:</strong>&nbsp;In the event a dispute arises between you and Reverb, please contact Reverb. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in Cook County, Illinois, using the English language administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find the AAA Rules here), unless otherwise required by law. **Arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the dispute, will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules, and in the case of CEDR, its rules.<br>
For EU sellers, if any dispute arises in connection with these Terms of Use, the parties should first try to resolve the dispute through the complaints procedure published here. In addition, the dispute may be referred by either party to the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (“CEDR”) for mediation. The Parties agree to enter into mediation to settle a good faith dispute and will do so in accordance with the CEDR’s mediation procedures. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties within 14 days of notice of the dispute, the mediator will be nominated by CEDR. To initiate the mediation a party must give notice in writing to the other party to the dispute, referring the dispute to mediation. A copy of the referral should be sent to CEDR. </p>

    <a id="ClassAction">
    </a>
</div>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>(B) Class Action and Collective Action Waiver: The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this Agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The tribunal shall rule on its own jurisdiction and the validity or enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate. </strong></p>

    <a id="Enforcement">

<p><strong>(C) Enforcement of Arbitration Judgment:</strong>&nbsp;Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. </p>
<div class="offset-anchor-wrapper">
    <a id="Jurisdiction">

<p><strong>(F) Intra-User Disputes and EU Dispute:</strong>&nbsp;In the event that you have a dispute with another Reverb user or third party, we encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve the dispute directly.  Should you have a dispute with one or more users, or an outside party, YOU RELEASE REVERB (AND REVERB'S OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND EMPLOYEES) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.

<h2 class="heading-4">23. Proposition 65 - California</h2><br>

<p>The California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Prop 65”) requires manufacturers, producers, packagers, importers, suppliers or distributors (the “Notice Parties”) of products to provide warnings to California consumers about potentially hazardous or cancer-causing materials in those products. &nbsp;Notice Parties are encouraged to include a warning that lists the specific chemicals in the product(s) if they are present in an amount that may be hazardous. Example warnings could read:</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals, including [name of chemical], which is/are known to the State of California to cause cancer. For more information, go to&nbsp;www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals, including [name of chemical], which is/are known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. For more information, go to&nbsp;www.P65Warnings.ca.gov.</strong></p>

<p>We encourage all Reverb users who sell to California residents to investigate the requirements and to make&nbsp;independent determinations about whether warnings are necessary when selling items to California residents. &nbsp;You can include warnings in your item descriptions on Reverb.  You agree to indemnify and hold Reverb harmless for any violations of Prop 65 or any claims arising out of your violation of Prop 65.</p> &nbsp;

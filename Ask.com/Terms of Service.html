<div class="PartialTermsOfService-heading" id="link13">13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</div>
<p>These Terms, and all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in
    contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, including California's statutes
    of limitations governing your claim, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of law, provided that the
    Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 14, the Class Action Waiver and
    Arbitration Agreement.
</p>
<p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Class Action Waiver and Arbitration Agreement is found not to
    apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order,
    you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and AMG must be resolved exclusively by
    a state or federal court located in the State of California. You and AMG agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction
    of the courts located within the State of California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
</p>
<div class="PartialTermsOfService-heading" id="link14">14. Class Action Waiver and Binding Arbitration</div>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A
    LAWSUIT IN COURT. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CLAIMS HEARD BY A JURY.
</p>
<p>ANY ARBITRATION AWARD PURSUANT TO THIS PROVISION IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT ONLY TO LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT
    INCLUDING LIMITED RIGHTS TO APPEAL THE ARBITRATION AWARD.
</p>
<p>14.1 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</p>
<p>YOU AND AMG AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
    OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND AMG
    EXPRESSLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AGAINST
    AMG AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE
    ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL
    PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
    ANY RELIEF AWARDED DOES NOT ENTITLE OTHER AMG USERS TO SIMILAR RELIEF. If any court or arbitrator determines that the
    class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can
    proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision in these Terms shall be deemed null and void in its entirety
    and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
</p>
<p>14.2 Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
<p>This Section 14 is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement”. By installing a Product and/or using the
    Products, Sites and Services, you agree that all claims relating to or arising out of the Products, Sites and Services
    or these Terms or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise that have arisen or may arise
    between you and AMG or its parent company and affiliates, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
    arbitration in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims
    in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
    overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
    enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
</p>
<p>14.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</p>
<p>AMG is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. You and AMG agree that good faith informal
    efforts to resolve claims and disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and AMG
    therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small
    claims court if a party so elects), you and AMG will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference,
    in a good faith effort to resolve informally any claim or dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal
    Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference,
    but you will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must give written notice to the other
    party of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), and the Informal Dispute
    Resolution Conference shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is
    mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to AMG that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution
    Conference should be sent by email to Ask Media Group, LLC., Attn: Legal Department, 1955 Broadway, Suite 350, Oakland, CA 94612.
    The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address ; (2) the name,
    telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of counsel, if any; and (3) a detailed description of your claim
    together with substantiation of the facts on which you base your claim.
</p>
<p>In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this
    Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating
    party’s claim. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that
    must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be
    tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.
</p>
<p>14.4 Arbitration Procedures</p>
<p>If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after
    receipt of the Notice, you and AMG agree that the claim or dispute shall be finally resolved through binding arbitration.
    Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the
    time the arbitration is initiated (collectively referred to as the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration
    Agreement, and excluding the JAMS Class Action Procedures. For information on JAMS, please visit its website available
    at https://www.jamsadr.com/. Information about JAMS’s Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the JAMS
    consumer arbitration page available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. If there is any
    inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will
    control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would
    not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms,
    including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 9 of these Terms.
</p>
<p>If your claim has not been resolved through the Dispute Resolution Conference, you may commence an arbitration against
    AMG by writing a demand for arbitration that includes: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e‐mail
    address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of
    those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in
    controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process
    as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with
    such arbitration. You can find a sample Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com. You should send three copies of the
    Demand, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS at Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111, and
    send one copy to AMG, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1955 Broadway, Suite 350 Oakland, CA 94612. For more information,
    see the JAMS arbitration rules and forms, https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download/. You may represent yourself in the
    arbitration or be represented by an attorney or another representative. Once we receive your arbitration claim, we may
    assert any counterclaims we may have against you.
</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought
    is $10,000 or less you or AMG may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written
    submissions, which election shall be binding on you and AMG subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an
    in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you
    and/or AMG, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all
    claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or
    otherwise and all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
    formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or
    voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief
    would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the
    parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will decide the
    substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of
    equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in
    prior arbitrations involving different users of Products, Services and Sites.
</p>
<p>The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and
    will be selected by the parties from JAMS’ roster of arbitrators with experience in consumer and/or internet industry
    disputes. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the
    Demand, then JAMS will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS rules, provided that if the
    Batch Arbitration process is triggered, JAMS will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.
</p>
<p>14.5 Costs of Arbitration</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by
    the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement to Arbitrate. Each party will be responsible for all other
    fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. In the event the
    arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse AMG for all
    fees associated with the arbitration paid by AMG.
</p>
<p>14.6 Confidentiality</p>
<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly
    confidential for the benefit of all parties.
</p>
<p>14.7 Limited Rights to Appeal</p>
<p>Once the arbitrator has rendered their award, it is binding on the parties and it is not possible to appeal an
    arbitration award to a court on the usual appellate grounds under federal or state laws. Under JAMS Rules, there are
    only very narrow grounds on which parties may appeal an arbitration award.
</p>
<p>14.8 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and AMG agree that if AMG makes any change to this
    Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, such
    change shall not be effective until at least 60 days from the date of posting, and shall not apply to any claim that
    was filed in a legal proceeding against AMG prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate
    this Arbitration Agreement from these Terms, such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the publication
    of the version of these Terms removing the Arbitration Agreement on the Site, and shall not be effective as to any claim
    that was filed in a legal proceeding against AMG prior to the effective date of removal.

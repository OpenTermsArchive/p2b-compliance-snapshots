The&nbsp;Agreement sets out the&nbsp;legally binding terms and&nbsp;conditions for&nbsp;your use of the website at&nbsp;<a href="https://merchant.joom.com">https://merchant.joom.com</a> and Joom’s mobile applications (both iOS and&nbsp;Android) and&nbsp;web-site at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.joom.com/">https://www.joom.com/</a> (all together referred to&nbsp;as the&nbsp;“Site”). By&nbsp;using the&nbsp;Site, you agree to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bound by&nbsp;this Agreement, including those additional terms and&nbsp;conditions and&nbsp;policies referenced herein and/or available by&nbsp;hyperlinks, including the&nbsp;terms and&nbsp;conditions set out in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Merchant Help Center available at&nbsp;<a href="https://eu-merchant-help.joom.com/hc">https://eu-merchant-help.joom.com/hc</a>. This Agreement applies to&nbsp;all merchants (those, who are selling to customers of the Site and&nbsp;hereinafter referred to&nbsp;as the&nbsp;“Merchants”, “Merchant” or “you”). Joom Intellectual Property Policy for&nbsp;Merchants constitutes an&nbsp;integral part of these Terms of Service and&nbsp;is available via&nbsp;<a href="https://merchant.joom.com/ip-policy/">https://merchant.joom.com/ip-policy/</a>.</p><p>The&nbsp;contents of this Agreement include the&nbsp;main body as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;all the&nbsp;terms, conditions and&nbsp;policies including (but&nbsp;without limitation) legal statements, privacy policies that have been or&nbsp;will be&nbsp;published or&nbsp;released by&nbsp;Joom at&nbsp;any time. All terms, conditions and&nbsp;policies of which you have been notified are an&nbsp;integral part of this Agreement and&nbsp;shall have the&nbsp;same legal effect as&nbsp;the main body of this Agreement.</p><p>By&nbsp;accepting these Terms of&nbsp;Service, you confirm that you will abide by&nbsp;all the relevant EU&nbsp;laws and regulations, including those of&nbsp;the EU&nbsp;Member States. You also agree to&nbsp;offer products on&nbsp;the Site that comply with any applicable requirements and restrictions.</p><h2>1. Joom as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Marketplace and&nbsp;Merchant’s Agent</h2><p>1.1. Joom provides a&nbsp;platform for&nbsp;Merchants who comply with Joom’s policies and requirements to&nbsp;offer and&nbsp;sell certain items.</p><p>1.2. Joom acts as&nbsp;a&nbsp;commercial agent of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Merchant within the scope of&nbsp;powers, rights and authorities set in&nbsp;this Agreement, including the powers and rights to&nbsp;negotiate and conclude transactions between Merchants and customers on&nbsp;the Site, set the final price for the items listed on&nbsp;the Site (“Items”), issue invoices for such Items, and (at&nbsp;Joom’s sole discretion) assist Merchants in&nbsp;the receipt and processing of&nbsp;customer’s claims for refund and guarantee on&nbsp;behalf of&nbsp;Merchant.</p><p>Joom, as a commercial agent of Merchant, acts in Merchant’s name and at Merchant’s expense. </p><p>Joom does not act as a commercial agent for a customer.</p><p>1.3. Customer’s payment obligation to&nbsp;Merchant shall be&nbsp;deemed as&nbsp;performed upon receipt of&nbsp;customer’s payment by&nbsp;Joom (or&nbsp;its payment services provider, as&nbsp;applicable), and Joom via its payment services provider, as&nbsp;applicable, is&nbsp;responsible for remitting the funds to&nbsp;Merchants in&nbsp;the manner described in&nbsp;Joom’s and Merchant’s agreement with payment services provider. If&nbsp;Joom (via payment services provider) does not remit any such amounts to&nbsp;Merchant, Merchant will have the right to&nbsp;recourse only against Joom (its payment services provider, as&nbsp;applicable) and not the customer directly.</p><p>1.4. Merchant authorizes Joom as&nbsp;an&nbsp;agent of&nbsp;Merchant to&nbsp;assist Merchant in&nbsp;handling and resolving customer’s claims and complaints that relate to&nbsp;refunds and guarantee in&nbsp;accordance with the policies set by&nbsp;Joom and/or&nbsp;PSP. For this purpose, Merchants shall be&nbsp;obliged to&nbsp;reply to&nbsp;Joom’s support agents and provide any necessary information that may be&nbsp;important for the case within 48 hours, but in&nbsp;any case, not later than within 5 calendar days. All the payments owed to&nbsp;Merchant shall be&nbsp;made by&nbsp;deducting or&nbsp;withholding the amounts of&nbsp;refund, compensation and other fees determined by&nbsp;Joom.</p><p>1.5. Merchant authorizes Joom to&nbsp;proceed with refunds, on&nbsp;the Merchant’s expense to&nbsp;customers when deemed necessary in&nbsp;customer claims, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;a&nbsp;violation of&nbsp;any applicable legislation or&nbsp;Joom’s terms and policies, even without receipt of&nbsp;any customer claim. Merchant agreed to&nbsp;cooperate and agree to&nbsp;Joom’s decisions on&nbsp;refunds in&nbsp;accordance with the applicable law and company’s policies and Joom shall notify Merchant of&nbsp;the result and reserves the right to&nbsp;final explanation.</p><p>1.6. Notwithstanding the above mentioned in&nbsp;clause 1.2, Joom has no&nbsp;control over the&nbsp;quality, safety, morality or&nbsp;legality of&nbsp;any aspect of&nbsp;Items, the&nbsp;truth or&nbsp;accuracy of&nbsp;the&nbsp;listings, the&nbsp;ability of&nbsp;Merchants to&nbsp;sell Items or&nbsp;the&nbsp;ability of&nbsp;customers to&nbsp;pay for&nbsp;Items.</p><p>Joom reserves the&nbsp;right to&nbsp;refuse Merchant’s application in&nbsp;the following cases:</p><ul><li>Absence of registration documents requested by&nbsp;Joom. To be admitted to the Site the Merchant shall be a legal entity or&nbsp;an entrepreneur properly registered in one of the European Union countries, in the United Kingdom or in Norway as such legal entity or entrepreneur and shall be properly registered for VAT purposes in the country of its principal place of business and/or, where applicable and required, in the country of destination (i.e. the country of customer’s residence).</li><li>Merchant’s product listing contains products either generally prohibited on&nbsp;Joom or&nbsp;prohibited and/or restricted for&nbsp;sale through the&nbsp;Site in&nbsp;the country of&nbsp;destination (i.e. the country from which the product can be&nbsp;ordered by&nbsp;the customer) and/or in&nbsp;the Merchant’s country. Please also refer to&nbsp;paragraph&nbsp;3.</li><li>Merchant has low ratings on&nbsp;other marketplaces (e-commerce platforms) or&nbsp;is&nbsp;not present on&nbsp;them at&nbsp;all.</li><li>There are bad references from&nbsp;trusted sources.</li></ul><h2>2. Merchant’s Eligibility and&nbsp;Obligations</h2><p>2.1. Merchants’ registration on&nbsp;the Site is&nbsp;available only to&nbsp;legal entities and entrepreneurs duly established in&nbsp;the EU, the UK&nbsp;or&nbsp;in&nbsp;Norway.

By&nbsp;entering into the Agreement, you represent and warrant that all information provided by&nbsp;you or&nbsp;any other information which may be&nbsp;provided in&nbsp;the future is&nbsp;full, accurate and up&nbsp;to&nbsp;date and you are duly authorized to&nbsp;sell your Items through the Site in&nbsp;accordance with the requirements of&nbsp;this Agreement.</p><p>2.2. You undertake to&nbsp;comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding online sale, advertising (by&nbsp;offering Items you therefore advertise them on&nbsp;the Site) and any restrictions which apply to&nbsp;you and your activity on&nbsp;the Site. You hereby agree that you are fully responsible for any breach of&nbsp;such obligation (as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;any other obligation under or&nbsp;in&nbsp;connection with this Agreement) including the responsibility for any losses and damages that may be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;such breach (including those arising from third party claims). You undertake to&nbsp;observe all Joom’s policies as&nbsp;stated in&nbsp;the Agreement and any other rules, policies and procedures that may be&nbsp;published from time to&nbsp;time on&nbsp;the Site by&nbsp;Joom, each of&nbsp;which may be&nbsp;updated by&nbsp;Joom.</p><p>2.3. You act as&nbsp;a&nbsp;seller of&nbsp;your products offered on&nbsp;the Site in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;consumer protection legislation applicable to&nbsp;the customer and remain solely and fully responsible for specifying in&nbsp;the product cards all mandatory information related to&nbsp;its product (including the information required to&nbsp;be&nbsp;provided to&nbsp;the consumer before it&nbsp;is&nbsp;bound by&nbsp;a&nbsp;distance contract as&nbsp;required by&nbsp;Directive 2011/83/EU of&nbsp;the European Parliament and of&nbsp;the Council of&nbsp;25 October 2011 on&nbsp;consumer rights). In&nbsp;particular, you are obliged to&nbsp;provide in&nbsp;product card information about the existence and the conditions of&nbsp;after sale customer assistance, after-sales services and legal and commercial guarantees.

You agree to&nbsp;immediately notify Joom of&nbsp;any unauthorized use of&nbsp;your password or&nbsp;any breach of&nbsp;security. You also agree that Joom cannot and will not be&nbsp;liable for any loss or&nbsp;damage arising from your failure to&nbsp;keep your password secure. You undertake not to&nbsp;provide your username and/or password information to&nbsp;any other party other than Joom without Joom’s express written permission.</p><p>2.6. You shall keep your account information up-to-date and accurate, including valid email addresses and payment information, including a&nbsp;correct bank account and any other payment details. If&nbsp;you do&nbsp;not comply with the aforementioned provisions, you assume all responsibility for losses caused by&nbsp;such failure to&nbsp;comply.</p><p>2.7. You have no&nbsp;right to&nbsp;transfer or&nbsp;sell your Joom Merchant account and username to&nbsp;another party. In&nbsp;case you have to&nbsp;accept any other terms or&nbsp;policies on&nbsp;the Site or&nbsp;take other actions bounding you by&nbsp;any obligations, acceptance of&nbsp;any such documents or&nbsp;changes by&nbsp;your representative to&nbsp;whom you provided access to&nbsp;the Site, your account on&nbsp;the Site and to&nbsp;any other features shall be&nbsp;considered as&nbsp;actions on&nbsp;your behalf by&nbsp;your authorised representative.</p><p>2.8. Joom’s services are not available to&nbsp;Joom Merchants with temporarily or&nbsp;indefinitely suspended accounts. Products that do&nbsp;not comply with Joom’s policies will be&nbsp;deleted from the Site. Merchants with repeated instances of&nbsp;noncompliance may have their accounts removed, access to&nbsp;the Merchant Dashboard revoked, and/or transactions cancelled.</p><h2>3. Prohibited Items</h2><p>3.1. You are&nbsp;responsible for&nbsp;observing applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations of&nbsp;countries of&nbsp;origin or&nbsp;destination, Joom’s policies and&nbsp;procedures, shipping restrictions and&nbsp;any other restrictions applicable to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Items and&nbsp;the&nbsp;selling process, including, but not limited to&nbsp;all applicable local regulations and standards regarding marking of&nbsp;products and any other labelling required by&nbsp;the&nbsp;law.

In&nbsp;such a&nbsp;case you also confirm and warrant that you have the right to&nbsp;use and provide Joom with such documents and it&nbsp;will satisfy all requirements of&nbsp;any applicable legislation. If&nbsp;any such documents shall be&nbsp;issued in&nbsp;your name as&nbsp;per applicable law, you undertake to&nbsp;obtain or&nbsp;issue and provide Joom with such documents prior to&nbsp;selling the products on&nbsp;the Site.</li></ul><p>3.2.

Economic sanctions laws in&nbsp;the European Union, the United States and a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;other countries prohibit or&nbsp;restrict unlicensed transactions with various parties (i.e., individuals, entities, government regimes) for example because they are identified as&nbsp;engaging in&nbsp;terrorism, narcotics trafficking, weapons proliferation and/or other activities that threaten those countries’ national security, foreign policies or&nbsp;economies or&nbsp;(and again for example), because they are resident in&nbsp;certain countries or&nbsp;have a&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;those countries (“Denied Parties”). Various government agencies publish lists, or&nbsp;descriptions, of&nbsp;such parties (“Denied Parties Lists”). In&nbsp;addition, many countries maintain trade sanctions and embargo programs against specific countries (“Sanctioned Countries”), such that unauthorized transactions involving these Sanctioned Countries or&nbsp;parties who are resident in&nbsp;those countries or&nbsp;have a&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;those countries are prohibited or&nbsp;restricted.</p><p>In order to comply with these and other legal requirements, it is Joom general policy that Items imported from or originating in the following countries and regions may not be sold on Joom:</p><ul><li>Cuba</li><li>Iran</li><li>North Korea</li><li>Syria</li><li>Sudan</li><li>Crimea Region</li><li>Luhansk Region</li><li>Donetsk Region</li><li>Kherson Region</li><li>Zaporizhzhia region</li><li>Any other country or region as may be notified to Merchants by Joom</li></ul><p>No shipments or sales to parties in any of these countries may be conducted through Joom.</p><p>Accounts may not be opened or affiliated with a country or region that Joom does not support.</p><p>5.2.

Merchant shall respond to&nbsp;such letter within 10 business days from the letter receipt, and either confirm the amount payable and provide Joom with any information that may be&nbsp;requested to&nbsp;execute the payment or&nbsp;provide Joom with evidence that the amount is&nbsp;not correct.

Ranking of&nbsp;products in&nbsp;response to&nbsp;the customer’s search query and recommendations of&nbsp;items to&nbsp;customers depend on&nbsp;several factors and their various combinations, aimed at&nbsp;optimizing the search query results and recommendations for a&nbsp;particular customer. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;determined by&nbsp;an&nbsp;automated ranking and recommender algorithm. Ranking of&nbsp;products in&nbsp;response to&nbsp;the customer’s search query and recommendations of&nbsp;items to&nbsp;customers depend on&nbsp;several factors and their various combinations, aimed at&nbsp;optimizing the search query results and recommendations for a&nbsp;particular customer.</p><p>The main parameters used by&nbsp;the ranking algorithm are those that indicate the product’s relevance for a&nbsp;particular customer and are based on&nbsp;the overall product’s popularity among the Site’s customers. Such parameters vary depending on&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular customer’s history, search query wording, the relevance of&nbsp;products to&nbsp;such wording, etc. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;exhaustive list of&nbsp;parameters as&nbsp;their number and degree of&nbsp;impact are different with regard to&nbsp;different customers. In&nbsp;other words, the more the product, its description, tags, rating, price, availability to&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular region (country of&nbsp;destination), etc. correspond to&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer, its history, preferences, search wording, etc., the more chances for such product to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the search query results. Product’s popularity is&nbsp;determined based on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;criteria, including, but not limited to&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;orders, number of&nbsp;reviews and the product’s rating according to&nbsp;such reviews, product’s price, popularity and reliability of&nbsp;the product’s brand. The algorithm used for determining products popularity is&nbsp;dynamically updated and may change the prioritization of&nbsp;one criterion over others influencing product ranking on&nbsp;the Site.</p><p>Ranking of products is based not only on the popularity of the product as compared to all other products on the Site but also on their popularity within particular products categories. Popularity includes, for example, the number of views of a particular product, number of orders and number of reviews. For example, if there are no products with orders history in a product category or none of them has a review, the algorithm will use other criteria to determine prioritization between the products within such category (such as brand, product’s price, etc.). Popularity includes, for example, number of views of a particular product, number of orders and number of reviews.</p><p>To understand better what parameters can affect your products’ ranking, please find below examples of parameters used by the ranking algorithm to determine which products correspond to a search result most:</p><ul><li>Wording of the query: products containing the words corresponding to the search query will be prioritized and will appear among the search query results more frequently.</li><li>Product’s category: products from the category with the name corresponding to the query wording most will be prioritized among the search results.</li><li>Product’s name, description and tags: products with names, words in descriptions and tags assigned by merchants corresponding to the query wording most will be prioritized.</li><li>Merchant’s store name and the brand name: the degree of matching the search query wording with the names of the store and the brand, and the popularity of the store and the brand affect the search query results.</li><li>Quality (such as relevance and clarity) of the information on the product provided by the Merchant and its level of detail.</li></ul><p>The accurate and complete product description, the clear and full name of&nbsp;the product, product’s photos of&nbsp;high quality among other factors may lead to&nbsp;the increase in&nbsp;the product’s card views by&nbsp;the customers and, therefore, may affect the frequency of&nbsp;the product’s appearance among the search query results. In&nbsp;particular, all the above-mentioned factors may affect the frequency of&nbsp;the product’s card access by&nbsp;the customers, while the frequency of&nbsp;such access and the number of&nbsp;times customers add a&nbsp;particular product to&nbsp;saved items or&nbsp;a&nbsp;product card in&nbsp;their turn increase the frequency of&nbsp;appearance of&nbsp;such item in&nbsp;the relevant searching results.</p><p>Products promoted via Joom Ads (as&nbsp;defined below) may constitute approximately up&nbsp;to&nbsp;30 percent of&nbsp;search results. The certain proportions vary depending on&nbsp;the search query and the number of&nbsp;products on&nbsp;the Site corresponding to&nbsp;the query.</p><p>10.2. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;section on&nbsp;the main page on&nbsp;the website version of&nbsp;the Site as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the app version, which contains the set of&nbsp;products that are shown to&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer prior to&nbsp;or&nbsp;without any search query. Products are chosen to&nbsp;such section on&nbsp;the Site by&nbsp;the automated algorithm as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The first and main set of&nbsp;rules used by&nbsp;the algorithm to&nbsp;choose products to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shown to&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer in&nbsp;such section can be&nbsp;described by&nbsp;three main groups of&nbsp;products that will be&nbsp;chosen by&nbsp;the algorithm:</p><ul><li>Products to&nbsp;be&nbsp;chosen to&nbsp;the section shall have reviews from the customers. This part will also include the products from stores that have Top Store status (please refer to&nbsp;the relevant section of&nbsp;the Merchant Help Center to&nbsp;familiarize yourself with the Top Store functionality and criteria). The proportion between products with reviews and products from Top Stores will depend on&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer’s region (for example, not every merchant having Top Store status can deliver products to&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular customer’s country), customer’s history on&nbsp;the Site, etc.</li><li>Products promoted via Joom Ads will consist approximately up to 30 per cent of all number of products visible in the section.</li><li>Randomly chosen products will also be&nbsp;included in&nbsp;the section. The randomness of&nbsp;such selection means that the algorithm will freely choose the products to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shown among all the products that are available to&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular customer, even if&nbsp;such products do&nbsp;not have views, reviews, etc.</li></ul><p>As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;products is&nbsp;composed using the above criteria, the following criteria are used by&nbsp;the algorithm to&nbsp;adapt the section to&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular customer:</p><ul><li>Whether a&nbsp;particular product can be&nbsp;delivered to&nbsp;the customer’s country.</li><li>Merchant’s performance in&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer’s country (rate of&nbsp;cancellations of&nbsp;orders, rate (number) of&nbsp;returns, etc).</li><li>Customer’s preferences (i.e. previous interactions of&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer with products, products categories, etc.).</li></ul><p>Please note that the algorithm is&nbsp;created and set in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;manner that will be&nbsp;intended on&nbsp;showing products that are the most relevant to&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular customer.</p><p>10.3. There are certain promotional instruments available to&nbsp;the Merchant, the information on&nbsp;which can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;the Merchant Help Center, such as&nbsp;special promotions, daily promotions, and Joom Ads (Joom Ads Terms of&nbsp;Service with detailed information about the tool available at&nbsp;https://merchant.joom.com/ads-terms/). The Merchant’s products participating in&nbsp;the promotions will appear in&nbsp;the search query results among other products satisfying the above-mentioned criteria (i.e. they match the search query wording, etc.), and, will be&nbsp;automatically prioritized over the products not participating in&nbsp;the promotions. Besides, the Merchant’s products participating in&nbsp;the promotions will be&nbsp;shown in&nbsp;the relevant search query results being supplemented by&nbsp;the standard discount badge or&nbsp;the “SALE” discount badge.</p><p>Please refer to the relevant sections of the Merchant Help Center to be sure that you are aware of the most up-to-date information on promotional instruments and the way the Merchant can use them.</p><p>10.4. When you place the product offers on&nbsp;the Site You agree that your products can be&nbsp;advertised via external marketing tools of&nbsp;third-party advertisers, including, but not limited to&nbsp;social network and search engines platforms.</p><p>Products advertised via external marketing channels are chosen by&nbsp;the algorithms using a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;different criteria such as&nbsp;product’s reviews, the number of&nbsp;orders of&nbsp;this product, the product’s price as&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;other identical or&nbsp;similar products, etc. In&nbsp;general, the more popular a&nbsp;particular product, the higher chances for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;chosen by&nbsp;the algorithm for external advertising. For the targeted advertising, the history of&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular customer’s interaction with products on&nbsp;the Site predetermines the products to&nbsp;be&nbsp;advertised to&nbsp;such customers via advertising channels.</p><p>The algorithms automatically update the prioritization of products between themselves using the above-mentioned criteria that are dynamically and automatically updated. The more popular the particular product becomes, the higher chances that it will be chosen by the algorithm for external advertising. Please note that external advertisers have their own set of rules that may affect the visibility and frequency of appearance of a particular product or product category on the advertiser’s platform. Joom cannot influence the advertiser’s platform rules and advertising mechanisms, as the result, neither the number of Merchant’s products that will be accepted for promotion and visibility of Merchant’s products in the external marketing channels.</p><p>Joom reserves the right to use certain products and/or categories of products for external advertising tests purposes. Such tests are limited in time and/or market of destination and help Joom to estimate the efficiency of advertising tools regarding such product categories or items and improve internal algorithms.</p><h2>11. Access to&nbsp;Data</h2><p>11.1. Joom as&nbsp;the provider of&nbsp;the Site has access to&nbsp;the information provided by&nbsp;or&nbsp;related to&nbsp;the Merchant and its activities on&nbsp;the Site (including, inter alia, Merchant’s legal entity registration details, full names of&nbsp;Merchant’s representatives, their email addresses and other contact details, other information provided by&nbsp;the Merchant during the registration and KYC process, information on&nbsp;the Merchant’s activities on&nbsp;the Site, its products, orders, available stocks). Categories of&nbsp;such data are specified in&nbsp;the Merchant Help Center (in&nbsp;particular, in&nbsp;“Set up&nbsp;your Account” and “KYC Profile” sections) and Joom’s API for Merchants available at&nbsp;api-v3-docs.merchant.joom.com.

Availability of&nbsp;categories of&nbsp;such data depends on&nbsp;the method of&nbsp;products shipping (i.e. via JL’s providers or&nbsp;via logistics routes to&nbsp;be&nbsp;chosen by&nbsp;Merchants themselves), logistics channel, country of&nbsp;dispatch, transit and destination. If&nbsp;the Merchant fulfill the order via channels other than JL, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;provided with the data necessary for the dispatch of&nbsp;the items such as&nbsp;the full name of&nbsp;the customer who made the order, the customer’s phone number, address specified by&nbsp;the customer as&nbsp;the delivery address. The Merchant has access to&nbsp;the above-mentioned information regardless of&nbsp;the logistics channel in&nbsp;case its provision is&nbsp;required under the legislation of&nbsp;Merchant’s country of&nbsp;registration. For the same regulatory reasons of&nbsp;the Merchant’s country or&nbsp;countries of&nbsp;transit, Merchants may be&nbsp;provided with passport details of&nbsp;customers who ordered Merchant’s products on&nbsp;the Site. If&nbsp;the Merchant fulfills the order via JL’s channels, the Merchant will be&nbsp;provided with the country and city of&nbsp;destination and ZIP code of&nbsp;the final recipient. For more information about JL, please refer to&nbsp;Joom Logistics Shipment and Delivery Terms. The Merchant has access only to&nbsp;the information referred to&nbsp;above that relates to&nbsp;the Merchant, its performance, orders, and does not have access to&nbsp;any such information provided by&nbsp;or&nbsp;to&nbsp;other Merchants.</p><p>There is a separate section in the Merchant’s account on the Site called “Analytics”. Via the mentioned section the Merchant may have access to the information about Merchant’s performance on the Site. For more details as to how the Analytics section works, please refer to the “Analytics tabs” section of the Merchant Help Center. The information available via the mentioned section will include the information about your performance on the Site only and does not give access to information about the performance of other Merchants on the Site.</p><p>Categories of information referred to above may be updated by Joom from time to time due to changes in the applicable legislation, types of services introduced and provided to the Merchant or Site’s rules. To ensure that you are aware of the most up-to-date information on the types of data provided to Joom, analytics, the Merchant’s performance metrics, please check your account on the Site (if you are already a registered merchant) and/or familiarize yourself with the relevant sections of the Merchant Help Center, including the “Account” section.</p><p>Joom reserves the right to use third-party providers of specific services (such as CRM service providers) mainly for more efficient communication with Merchants (for example, to assign particular Merchant support managers as responsible for cooperation with the Merchant and to maintain such communication), and such involvement cannot be opted out by Merchants as it is necessary for proper operation of the Site and due level of provision of Merchants with services. Please contact merchant support team for further information on such providers.</p><p>The technical and contractual access to any of the information referred above, available at the Merchant’s account on the Site and provided to Joom within the term of this Agreement will be blocked in case of termination of these Terms.</p><p>11.2. The above information and aggregated data, including data related to&nbsp;the Merchant’s performance on&nbsp;the Site, will be&nbsp;available to&nbsp;Joom during the whole term of&nbsp;this Agreement and upon its expiration or&nbsp;termination for any reason and may be&nbsp;used by&nbsp;Joom (and Joom hereby reserves the right to&nbsp;use any such data and information), for example, to&nbsp;improve and subsequently develop the platform and the services, create new features and services or&nbsp;increase the quality of&nbsp;the existing features and tools, and improve the Site’s security mechanisms unless there are any mandatory provisions of&nbsp;the applicable legislation that restrict or&nbsp;prohibit Joom to&nbsp;use such information. </p><h2>12. Complaint Handling Procedure. Mediation and Dispute Resolution.</h2><p>12.1. Internal complaint-handling system:</p><p>12.1.1. Both Joom and Merchant shall take reasonable steps in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;resolve any disputes amicably, timely and in&nbsp;an&nbsp;efficient manner.

Any claim or&nbsp;request filed with the internal complaint-handling procedure will be&nbsp;reviewed by&nbsp;the Joom’s merchant support team based on&nbsp;these Terms and any other terms, conditions and policies applicable to&nbsp;the Merchant. Merchant is&nbsp;informed of&nbsp;the average response time to&nbsp;the Merchant’s request in&nbsp;the merchant support chat or&nbsp;via email (in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;contacting the merchant support team via merchant@joom.com). The time required for the response depends on&nbsp;the complexity of&nbsp;the matter and cooperation of&nbsp;the Merchant. In&nbsp;case it&nbsp;is&nbsp;necessary, the merchant support team may request additional information or&nbsp;clarifications to&nbsp;assess the request, and Merchant will be&nbsp;informed of&nbsp;any extension to&nbsp;the processing time. Issues related to&nbsp;the operations on&nbsp;the Site and technical features are usually handled within 1 business&nbsp;day.

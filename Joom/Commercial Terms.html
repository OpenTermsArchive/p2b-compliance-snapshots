The&nbsp;Agreement sets out the&nbsp;legally binding terms and&nbsp;conditions for&nbsp;your use of the website at&nbsp;<a href="https://merchant.joom.com">https://merchant.joom.com</a> and Joom’s mobile applications (both iOS and&nbsp;Android) and&nbsp;web-site at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.joom.com/">https://www.joom.com/</a> (all together referred to&nbsp;as the&nbsp;“Site”). By&nbsp;using the&nbsp;Site, you agree to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bound by&nbsp;this Agreement, including those additional terms and&nbsp;conditions and&nbsp;policies referenced herein and/or available by&nbsp;hyperlinks, including the&nbsp;terms and&nbsp;conditions set out in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Merchant Help Center available at&nbsp;<a href="https://eu-merchant-help.joom.com/hc">https://eu-merchant-help.joom.com/hc</a>. This Agreement applies to&nbsp;all merchants (those, who are selling to users of the Site and&nbsp;hereinafter referred to&nbsp;as the&nbsp;“Merchants”, “Merchant” or “you”). Joom Intellectual Property Policy for&nbsp;Merchants constitutes an&nbsp;integral part of these Terms of Service and&nbsp;is available via&nbsp;<a href="https://merchant.joom.com/ip-policy/">https://merchant.joom.com/ip-policy/</a>.</p><p>The&nbsp;contents of this Agreement include the&nbsp;main body as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;all the&nbsp;terms, conditions and&nbsp;policies including (but&nbsp;without limitation) legal statements, privacy policies that have been or&nbsp;will be&nbsp;published or&nbsp;released by&nbsp;Joom at&nbsp;any time. All terms, conditions and&nbsp;policies are an&nbsp;integral part of this Agreement and&nbsp;shall have the&nbsp;same legal effect as&nbsp;the main body of this Agreement.</p><h2>1. Joom as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Marketplace and&nbsp;Merchant’s Agent</h2><p>1.1. Joom provides a&nbsp;platform for&nbsp;Merchants who comply with Joom’s policies and requirements to&nbsp;offer and&nbsp;sell certain items.</p><p>Joom acts as a commercial agent of a Merchant within the scope of powers, rights and authorities set in this Agreement, including the powers and rights to negotiate and conclude transactions between Merchants and customers on the Site, set the final price for the items listed on the Site (“Items”), issue invoices for such Items, and (at Joom’s sole discretion) assist Merchants in the receipt and processing of customer’s claims for refund and guarantee on behalf of Merchant.</p><p>Joom, as a commercial agent of Merchant, acts in Merchant’s name and at Merchant’s expense. Joom does not act as a commercial agent for a customer.</p><p>Customer’s payment obligation to Merchant shall be deemed as performed upon receipt of customer’s payment by Joom (or its payment services provider, as applicable), and Joom via its payment services provider, as applicable, is responsible for remitting the funds to Merchants in the manner described in Joom’s and Merchant’s agreement with payment services provider. If Joom (via payment services provider) does not remit any such amounts to Merchant, Merchant will have recourse only against Joom (its payment services provider, as applicable) and not the customer directly.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above mentioned in clause 1.2, Joom has no&nbsp;control over the&nbsp;quality, safety, morality or&nbsp;legality of any aspect of Items, the&nbsp;truth or&nbsp;accuracy of the&nbsp;listings, the&nbsp;ability of Merchants to&nbsp;sell Items or&nbsp;the&nbsp;ability of customers to&nbsp;pay for&nbsp;Items.</p><p>Joom reserves the&nbsp;right to&nbsp;refuse Merchant’s application in&nbsp;the following cases:</p><ul><li>Absence of registration documents requested by&nbsp;Joom. To be admitted to the Site the Merchant shall be a legal entity or&nbsp;an entrepreneur properly registered in one of the European Union countries or in&nbsp;the&nbsp;United Kingdom as such legal entity or entrepreneur and shall be properly registered for VAT purposes in the country of its principal place of business and/or, where applicable and required, in the country of destination (i.e. the country of customer’s residence).</li><li>Merchant’s product listing contains products either generally prohibited on&nbsp;Joom or&nbsp;prohibited and/or restricted for&nbsp;sale through the&nbsp;Site in&nbsp;the country of destination (i.e. the country from which the product can be ordered by the user) and/or in the Merchant’s country. Please also refer to&nbsp;paragraph&nbsp;3.</li><li>Merchant has low ratings on&nbsp;other marketplaces (e-commerce platforms) or&nbsp;is&nbsp;not present on&nbsp;them at&nbsp;all.</li><li>There are bad references from&nbsp;trusted sources.</li></ul><h2>2. Merchant’s Eligibility and&nbsp;Obligations</h2><p>2.1. Merchants’ registration on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Site is available only to&nbsp;legal entities and&nbsp;entrepreneurs duly established in the EU or in the UK. Your status of the legal entity requires you to ensure that your activity on the Site and your products are fully compliant with the legislation applicable to the consumer (including, but not limited to the provision of mandatory information about you and your product to consumers and ensuring consumers’ rights). By&nbsp;entering into the&nbsp;Agreement, you represent and&nbsp;warrant that all information provided by you or any other information which may be provided in the future is full, accurate and&nbsp;up to&nbsp;date and&nbsp;you are duly authorized to&nbsp;sell your Items through the&nbsp;Site in&nbsp;accordance with the&nbsp;requirements of this Agreement. Joom may refuse to&nbsp;provide an&nbsp;access to&nbsp;the Site to&nbsp;any entrepreneur or&nbsp;entity and&nbsp;change the&nbsp;Merchant’s eligibility criteria at&nbsp;any time upon its discretion.</p><p>2.2. You undertake to&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;all applicable laws and regulations regarding online sale, advertising (by&nbsp;offering Items you therefore advertise them on&nbsp;the Site) and&nbsp;any restrictions which apply to you and your activity on the Site. You hereby agree that you are fully responsible for&nbsp;any breach of such obligation (as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;any other obligation under or in connection with this Agreement) including the&nbsp;responsibility for&nbsp;any losses and&nbsp;damages that may be caused by&nbsp;such breach (including those arising from the&nbsp;claims of the&nbsp;third parties). You undertake to&nbsp;observe all Joom’s policies as&nbsp;stated in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Agreement and&nbsp;any other rules, policies and&nbsp;procedures that may be published from&nbsp;time to&nbsp;time on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Site by&nbsp;Joom, each of which may be updated by&nbsp;Joom from&nbsp;time to&nbsp;time without notice to&nbsp;you.</p><p>2.3. You act as a seller of your products offered on the Site in terms of consumer protection legislation applicable to the customer and remain solely and fully responsible for specifying in the product cards all mandatory information related to its product (including the information required to be provided to the consumer before it is bound by a distance contract as required by Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights). In particular, you are obliged to provide in product card information about the existence and the conditions of after sale customer assistance, after-sales services and legal and commercial guarantees. For the above purposes, you must specify in your account on the Site valid and actual contact details that will be shown in products cards and guarantee that customers may contact you via such credentials to receive information about your products, address to you their claims or for any other matters within the scope of consumer protection.</p><p>2.4. In case you specify in product cards any features or labels, or your product description contains any claims (for example, related to the content of the product (‘free of X ingredients’ or ‘approved by X number of customers’), you guarantee that any such feature, claim or label are true and correct.</p><p>2.5. You agree to&nbsp;immediately notify Joom of any unauthorized use of your password or&nbsp;any breach of security. You also agree that Joom cannot and&nbsp;will not&nbsp;be liable for&nbsp;any loss or&nbsp;damage arising from&nbsp;your failure to&nbsp;keep your password secure. You undertake not&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide your username and/or password information to&nbsp;any other party other than Joom without Joom’s express written permission.</p><p>2.6. You shall keep your account information up-to-date and&nbsp;accurate, including a&nbsp;valid email addresses and correct bank account and any other payment details. To&nbsp;be able to sell Items on&nbsp;Joom you shall provide and&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;valid payment information. If you do not&nbsp;comply with the&nbsp;aforementioned provisions, you assume all responsibility for&nbsp;losses caused by&nbsp;such failure to&nbsp;comply.</p><p>2.7. You have no right to&nbsp;transfer or&nbsp;sell your Joom Merchant account and&nbsp;username to&nbsp;another party.</p><p>2.8. Joom’s services are not&nbsp;available to&nbsp;Joom Merchants with temporarily or&nbsp;indefinitely suspended accounts. Joom reserves the&nbsp;right to&nbsp;refuse service to&nbsp;anyone, for&nbsp;any reason, at&nbsp;any time. Products that do not&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;Joom’s policies will be deleted from the&nbsp;Site. Merchants with&nbsp;repeated instances of noncompliance may have their accounts removed, access to&nbsp;the Merchant Dashboard revoked, and/or transactions cancelled.</p><h2>3. Prohibited Items</h2><p>3.1. Every Merchant is&nbsp;responsible for&nbsp;observing applicable laws and&nbsp;regulations of the&nbsp;EU and/or the&nbsp;UK as well as applicable laws and regulations of any other country of origin or&nbsp;destination, Joom’s policies and&nbsp;procedures, shipping restrictions and&nbsp;any other restrictions applicable to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Items and&nbsp;the&nbsp;selling process.</p><p>When you upload documents such as&nbsp;declarations of conformity, any mandatory or&nbsp;self-declaratory documents and&nbsp;certificates to&nbsp;the&nbsp;products you sell on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Site, you confirm and&nbsp;warrant:</p><ul><li>That such documents are valid, up to&nbsp;date, and&nbsp;relate to&nbsp;those products to&nbsp;which you upload them as&nbsp;supporting ones.</li><li>If the&nbsp;documents are issued for a&nbsp;company or a&nbsp;person another than you, such documents are issued in the&nbsp;name of a&nbsp;manufacturer, distributor, or&nbsp;another establishment that has the&nbsp;obligation under the&nbsp;applicable legislation to&nbsp;obtain such documents and&nbsp;that such manufacturer, distributor, or&nbsp;other establishment obtained the&nbsp;documents in&nbsp;full legal compliance with the&nbsp;applicable procedures and&nbsp;legislation. In&nbsp;such a&nbsp;case you also confirm and&nbsp;warrant that you have the&nbsp;right to&nbsp;use and&nbsp;provide Joom with such documents and&nbsp;it will satisfy all requirements of any applicable legislation. If in&nbsp;accordance with the&nbsp;applicable legislation any such documents shall be issued in&nbsp;your name, you undertake to&nbsp;obtain or&nbsp;issue such documents and&nbsp;provide Joom with&nbsp;them prior to&nbsp;selling the&nbsp;products on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Site.</li></ul><p>3.2. There are some types of Items that we don’t allow on&nbsp;the Site, even if they are legal and&nbsp;otherwise meet Joom’s selling criteria. The&nbsp;following types of Items may not&nbsp;be listed on&nbsp;Joom:</p><ul><li>Certain animal and&nbsp;plant species (such as&nbsp;exotic animals).</li><li>Counterfeits.</li><li>Goods coming from&nbsp;outside the&nbsp;EEA that have not&nbsp;been introduced in&nbsp;the&nbsp;EEA with the&nbsp;owner of the&nbsp;IP right or&nbsp;with its consent.</li><li>Cultural heritage.</li><li>Drugs and&nbsp;illegal substances.</li><li>Firearms, explosives and&nbsp;ammunition.</li><li>Human cells, genes, organs and&nbsp;body parts.</li><li>All medicines (or&nbsp;other medical products and devices).</li><li>Orthopedic products and&nbsp;prosthesis.</li><li>Products that incite violence, fostered racial, ethnic or&nbsp;religious hatred, or&nbsp;advocated discrimination against any&nbsp;group.</li><li>Radioactive material, flammable material, combustible, corrosive and&nbsp;explosive materials.</li><li>Stamps in&nbsp;current use.</li><li>Tobacco in&nbsp;general (including electronic cigarettes and&nbsp;hand rolling).</li><li>Alcohol and&nbsp;drinks.</li><li>Products without certificates or&nbsp;licenses which are mandatory for such types of products according to the&nbsp;regulations of the&nbsp;EU and/or the&nbsp;UK, applicable legislation of the country of origin and/or country of destination.</li><li>Goods that do not&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;general or&nbsp;specific advertising or&nbsp;labelling rules applicable in&nbsp;the EU and/or the&nbsp;UK, the country of origin and the&nbsp;country of destination.</li></ul><p>3.3. Products listed in&nbsp;paragraph 3.2 will be removed from the&nbsp;Site, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Merchant’s selling privileges may be suspended and/or terminated.</p><p>3.4. In case of sale of non-perishable food products and food supplements (if permitted by the&nbsp;regulations of the&nbsp;EU and/or the&nbsp;UK, the applicable legislation of the country of origin and the country of destination), you guarantee and warrant that:</p><ul><li>Such products comply with the applicable legislation relating to food products (including, but not limited to any applicable customs regulations/restriction).</li><li>Such products have labels with all mandatory information required by the country of origin and/or the country of destination (including, but not&nbsp;limited to&nbsp;EU Regulation No. 1169/2011 of 25 October 2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, local regulations of the country of origin and the country of destination regarding labelling and provision of the information on the local language).</li><li>Information provided on the products is full and not misleading.

Such information shall not attribute to the food effects or properties which it does not possess.</li><li>Food supplements do not fall into the categories of medicines and do not require obtaining mandatory certificates (or, if food supplements require such certificates and can be sold online according to the applicable legislation, you guarantee and warrant that all necessary certificates are obtained).</li><li>Food supplements marked as such products and that description and labeling of such products do not attribute to food supplements the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease, or do not refer to such properties.</li></ul><p>You hereby also guarantee and confirm that you are duly authorized to sell such products under any applicable legislation and agree that you remain entirely and exclusively liable for the sale of such products.</p><p>3.5. Please note that the Site’s audience may include children as young as 13 years of age. Items that may be inappropriate for children to view or buy may be considered as inappropriate for Joom.</p><h2>4. Trade Control Laws</h2><p>4.1. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the EU and/or the&nbsp;UK, the country of origin and&nbsp;the&nbsp;country of destination when selling Items on&nbsp;Joom. You are responsible for&nbsp;determining all applicable trade control, customs and&nbsp;tax laws, obtaining any&nbsp;required government authorizations, and&nbsp;are liable for&nbsp;any penalties resulting from&nbsp;non-compliance.</p><h2>5. Economic Sanctions Laws</h2><p>5.1. Economic sanctions laws in the European Union, the United States and a number of other countries prohibit or restrict unlicensed transactions with various parties (i.e., individuals, entities, government regimes) for example because they are identified as engaging in terrorism, narcotics trafficking, weapons proliferation and/or other activities that threaten those countries’ national security, foreign policies or economies or (and again for example), because they are resident in certain countries or have a connection to those countries (“Denied Parties”). Various government agencies publish lists, or descriptions, of such parties (“Denied Parties Lists”). In addition, many countries maintain trade sanctions and embargo programs against specific countries (“Sanctioned Countries”), such that unauthorized transactions involving these Sanctioned Countries or parties who are resident in those countries or have a connection to those countries are prohibited or restricted.</p><p>In order to comply with these and other legal requirements, it is Joom general policy that Items imported from or originating in the following countries and regions may not be sold on Joom:</p><ul><li>Cuba</li><li>Iran</li><li>North Korea</li><li>Syria</li><li>Sudan</li><li>Crimea Region</li><li>Luhansk Region</li><li>Donetsk Region</li><li>Any other country or region as may be notified to Merchants by Joom</li></ul><p>No shipments or sales to parties in any of these countries may be conducted through Joom.</p><p>Accounts may not be opened or affiliated with a country or region that Joom does not support.</p><p>5.2. Additionally, Merchants must not do business with or otherwise engage in or facilitate transactions involving parties, services, and/or goods that are subject to sanctions or other applicable trade control restrictions. This includes, but is not limited to Denied Parties, parties that are owned or controlled by Denied Parties and also parties who are resident in or connected with any country or region if any economic sanctions law that applies to Joom, a Merchant or to any Buyer if and to the extent that such laws prohibit the applicable transaction.</p><p>5.3. You must ascertain and comply with any sanctions compliance requirements that apply to your transactions, including any updates to any laws that apply to Joom, a Merchant or to any Buyer and must indemnify Joom against any claim resulting from any breach by you of any sanctions law or and breach by you of this clause 5. Non-compliance with sanctions laws and regulations can result in significant civil and/or criminal monetary penalties, as well as possible imprisonment, seizure of goods, and/or a ban from conducting business.</p><h2>6. Fees, Payments and&nbsp;Delivery</h2><p>6.1. Joining and&nbsp;setting up a&nbsp;shop on&nbsp;Joom is free, unless Joom notifies otherwise. Joom’s commission rates for the&nbsp;commercial agent’s services under this Agreement are specified in&nbsp;the&nbsp;“Take Rate Policy on&nbsp;Joom” section in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Merchant Help Center. Commission for&nbsp;Joom commercial agent’s services under this Agreement amounts to&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain percentage from&nbsp;each Item’s original price (including VAT) agreed between Joom and&nbsp;Merchant and&nbsp;which is adjusted considering sales, promotions, special deals in&nbsp;accordance with clause&nbsp;6.9 of this Agreement. Unless otherwise stated, all prices and&nbsp;fees are quoted in&nbsp;Euro. Joom reserves the&nbsp;right to&nbsp;determine a&nbsp;new applicable commission at&nbsp;any time upon its discretion.</p><p>6.2. Joom does not provide payment services. Joom is entitled to&nbsp;determine payment services providers who will take all necessary actions for&nbsp;payment, acceptance, acquiring, processing and&nbsp;servicing of payments associated with&nbsp;transactions between Merchant and&nbsp;customer (“Payments service provider” or “PSP”). Joom reserves the&nbsp;right to&nbsp;designate any number of PSPs.</p><p>6.3. Joom supports business relations only with Merchants that use the payments services of PSP(s), designated by Joom. Merchant is responsible for performance of its obligations arising out of legal and business relations between Joom, Merchant and PSP, including paying all fees and providing all documents and information required by PSP. PSP shall hold the funds on behalf of Merchants and shall be responsible for provision of other payment services (remittance, withdrawal, etc.) in accordance with the agreements concluded by Merchant with PSP.</p><p>6.4. Merchant hereby authorizes Joom to:</p><p>6.4.1. Collect, process and disclose to PSP in connection with PSP payment services all necessary information on Merchant, its transactions that have been concluded on the Site with customers.</p><p>6.4.2. Open accounts for the purpose of providing payment services by PSP to Merchant and send instructions to PSP to deduct the funds in these accounts to repay the amounts owed by Merchant to Joom under this Agreement and credit any amount into such account as determined by Joom in accordance with this Agreement.</p><p>6.4.3. Instruct PSP to freeze, unfreeze, credit, remit or debit the Merchant’s account with PSP. The amount of the funds subject to freeze (minimal security deposit) may be applied, in which case it will be set in the relevant section of the Merchant Help Center. In any case the withdrawal is available only after a safety clearance period of maximum 75 days and only in the amount available to you.</p><p>6.4.4. Issue invoices on behalf of Merchant for the sale of Items on the Site, taking into consideration necessary deductions of fees, compensation and remuneration owed to Joom and its engaged service providers.</p><p>6.5. Merchant may withdraw the authorization given under clauses 6.4.1.-6.4.3 of this Agreement by giving seven days’ prior written notice to Joom and PSP. The withdrawal of authorization shall be deemed effective upon expiration of the notice period stipulated in this clause and shall not have retroactive effect, i.e. it shall not apply to the transaction and/or activities of the Merchant and/or Joom and/or PSP occurred prior to the expiration of the notice period set out in this clause.</p><p>6.6. Merchant shall ensure that account balance with PSP has sufficient balance for payments of funds owed to Joom. You are responsible for&nbsp;paying all fees and&nbsp;applicable taxes associated with&nbsp;using the&nbsp;Site and&nbsp;selling Items on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Site.</p><p>6.7. Merchants are required to&nbsp;list prices for&nbsp;Items they sell through the&nbsp;Site and&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide Joom with&nbsp;a shipping price (including the&nbsp;return shipping costs in&nbsp;case the&nbsp;customer expresses its wish to&nbsp;return the&nbsp;item within any period from the&nbsp;order date until 14&nbsp;calendar days followed after the&nbsp;date of the&nbsp;item’s receipt or&nbsp;under the&nbsp;guarantee). A&nbsp;return label is enclosed in&nbsp;each parcel sent for&nbsp;potential return of the&nbsp;goods in&nbsp;case the&nbsp;customer requests&nbsp;so. Joom may also provide Merchants with&nbsp;a&nbsp;solution for&nbsp;the&nbsp;return shipping labels’ generation.</p><p>6.8. Joom reserves the&nbsp;right to:</p><p>6.8.1. Set or adjust the final&nbsp;prices of Items and determine the shipping costs displayed to&nbsp;users.</p><p>6.8.2. Initiate sales, promotions, special deals in relation to Items offered by Merchants on the Site.</p><p>Provisions of clauses 6.8.1 and 6.8.2 do not&nbsp;affect the&nbsp;amount or&nbsp;percentage Joom has agreed to&nbsp;pay to&nbsp;Merchant for&nbsp;Items sold by&nbsp;such Merchant (provided in&nbsp;clause 6.1. above).</p><p>6.9. Sales, promotions, special deals initiated by Merchant on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Site are subject to&nbsp;a&nbsp;prior written approval by Joom and&nbsp;shall be made in&nbsp;compliance with the applicable laws and&nbsp;regulations of the&nbsp;EU and/or the&nbsp;UK and the laws and regulations of the Merchant’s place of business. Joom and Merchant may agree on other sales, promotions, special deals in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;Items offered by&nbsp;Merchants.</p><p>6.10. Unless otherwise informed by Joom, the default payment period for&nbsp;Merchants is 30&nbsp;calendar days since the&nbsp;shipment date, confirmed by&nbsp;the&nbsp;data of the&nbsp;tracking number. Joom intends to provide necessary information to PSP for the pay-out to Merchant not later than 30 calendar days from the shipment date.&nbsp;</p><p>Joom will pay Merchants for&nbsp;their completed transactions 2&nbsp;times a&nbsp;month. This payment will be a&nbsp;net amount: Merchant’s items’ prices less Joom’s commission, any refund and compensations. In the event Joom introduces a new service, the fees for that service (added to a commission defined in 6.1.) are effective from its launch date and will be charged from amounts payable. Transactions that cannot be confirmed as&nbsp;delivered may be ineligible for&nbsp;payment. Any payment instructed by Joom to PSP will be net of the amount due for the logistics and related services provided to you by Joom Logistics Limited (“JL”) as per separate agreement (Joom Logistics Shipment and Delivery Terms available at merchant.joom.com/jl-terms/version1) in case Merchant uses JL’s channels for the delivery of orders and other services specified in the mentioned terms.</p><p>Joom utilizes Hyperwallet as payment services to deliver payments to Merchants collected via selected payment methods/options.

Ranking. Promotional Activities</h2><p>8.1. Ranking of products as the results of the user’s search query depends on several factors and their various combinations, aimed at optimizing the search query results for a particular user.</p><p>The ranking of products is determined by an automated ranking algorithm. The main parameters used by the ranking algorithm are those that indicate the product’s relevance for a particular user and are based on the overall product’s popularity among the Site’s users. Such parameters vary depending on a particular user’s history, search query wording, the relevance of products to such wording, etc. There is no exhaustive list of parameters as their number and degree of impact are different with regard to different users. In other words, the more product, its description, tags, rating, price, availability to a particular region (country of destination), etc. correspond to a user, its history, preferences, search wording, etc., the more chances for such product to be on the top of the search query results. Product’s popularity is determined based on the set of criteria, including, but not limited to the number of orders, number of reviews and the product’s rating according to such reviews, product’s price, popularity and reliability of the product’s brand. The algorithm used for determining products popularity is dynamically updated and may change the prioritization of one criterion over others influencing product ranking on the Site.</p><p>Ranking of products is based not only on the popularity of the product as compared to all other products on the Site but also on their popularity within particular products categories. Popularity includes, for example, the number of views of a particular product, number of orders and number of reviews. For example, if there are no products with orders history in a product category or none of them has a review, the algorithm will use other criteria to determine prioritization between the products within such category (such as brand, product’s price, etc.). Popularity includes, for example, number of views of a particular product, number of orders and number of reviews.</p><p>To understand better what parameters can affect your products’ ranking, please find below examples of parameters used by the ranking algorithm to determine which products correspond to a search result most:</p><ul><li>Wording of the query: products containing the words corresponding to the search query will be prioritized and will appear among the search query results more frequently.</li><li>Product’s category: products from the category with the name corresponding to the query wording most will be prioritized among the search results.</li><li>Product’s name, description and tags: products with names, words in descriptions and tags assigned by merchants corresponding to the query wording most will be prioritized.</li><li>Merchant’s store name and the brand name: the degree of matching the search query wording with the names of the store and the brand, and the popularity of the store and the brand affect the search query results.</li><li>Quality (such as relevance and clarity) of the information on the product provided by the Merchant and its level of detail.</li></ul><p>The accurate and complete product description, the clear and full name of the product, product’s photos of high quality among other factors may lead to the increase in the product’s card views by the users and, therefore, may affect the frequency of the product’s appearance among the search query results. In particular, all the above-mentioned factors may affect the frequency of the product’s card access by the users, while the frequency of such access and the number of times users add a particular product to saved items or a product card in their turn increase the frequency of appearance of such item in the relevant searching results.</p><p>Products promoted via Joom Ads (as defined below) may constitute approximately up to 30 per cent of search results. The certain proportions vary depending on the search query and the number of products on the Site corresponding to the query.</p><p>8.2. There is a section on the main page on the website version of the Site as well as in the app version, which contains the set of products that are shown to a user prior to or without any search query. Products are chosen to such section on the Site by the automated algorithm as well.</p><p>The first and main set of rules used by the algorithm to choose products to be shown to a user in such section can be described by three main groups of products that will be chosen by the algorithm:</p><ul><li>Products to be chosen to the section shall have reviews from the users. This part will also include the products from stores that have Top Store status (please refer to the relevant section of the Merchant Help Center to familiarize yourself with the Top Store functionality and criteria). The proportion between products with reviews and products from Top Stores will depend on a user’s region (for example, not every merchant having Top Store status can deliver products to a particular user’s country), user's history on the Site, etc.</li><li>Products promoted via Joom Ads will consist approximately up to 30 per cent of all number of products visible in the section.</li><li>Randomly chosen products will also be included in the section. The randomness of such selection means that the algorithm will freely choose the products to be shown among all the products that are available to a particular user, even if such products do not have views, reviews, etc.</li></ul><p>As soon as the set of products is composed using the above criteria, the following criteria are used by the algorithm to adapt the section to a particular user:</p><ul><li>Whether a particular product can be delivered to the user’s country.</li><li>Merchant’s performance in a user’s country (rate of cancellations of orders, rate (number) of returns, etc).</li><li>User’s preferences (i.e. previous interactions of a user with products, products categories, etc.).</li></ul><p>Please note that the algorithm is created and set in such a manner that will be intended on showing products that are the most relevant to a particular user.</p><p>8.3. There are certain promotional instruments available to the Merchant, the information on which can be found in the Merchant Help Center, such as special promotions, daily promotions, and Joom Ads (Joom Ads Terms of Service with detailed information about the tool available at https://merchant.joom.com/ads-terms/). The Merchant’s products participating in the promotions will appear in the search query results among other products satisfying the above-mentioned criteria (i.e. they match the search query wording, etc.), and in addition, they will be automatically prioritized over the products not participating in the promotions. Besides, the Merchant’s products participating in the promotions will be shown in the relevant search query results being supplemented by the standard discount badge or the “SALE” discount badge.</p><p>Please refer to the relevant sections of the Merchant Help Center to be sure that you are aware of the most up-to-date information on promotional instruments and the way the Merchant can use them.</p><p>8.4. When you place the product offers on the Site You agree that your products can be advertised via external marketing tools of third-party advertisers, including, but not limited to social network and search engines platforms.</p><p>Products advertised via external marketing channels are chosen by the algorithms using a set of different criteria such as product’s reviews, the number of orders of this product, the product’s price as compared to other identical or similar products, etc. In general, the more popular a particular product the higher chances for it to be chosen by the algorithm to the external advertising. For the targeted advertising, the history of a particular user’s interaction with products on the Site predetermines the products to be advertised to such users via advertising channels.</p><p>The algorithms automatically update the prioritization of products between themselves using the above-mentioned criteria that are dynamically and automatically updated. The more popular the particular product becomes, the higher chances that it will be chosen by the algorithm for external advertising. Please note that external advertisers have their own set of rules that may affect the visibility and frequency of appearance of a particular product or product category on the advertiser’s platform. Joom cannot influence the advertiser’s platform rules and advertising mechanisms, as the result, neither the number of Merchant’s products that will be accepted for promotion and visibility of Merchant’s products in the external marketing channels.</p><p>Joom reserves the right to use certain products and/or categories of products for external advertising tests purposes. Such tests are limited in time and/or market of destination and help Joom to estimate the efficiency of advertising tools regarding such product categories or items and improve internal algorithms.</p><h2>9.

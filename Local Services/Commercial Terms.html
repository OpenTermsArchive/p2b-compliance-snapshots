         <ol start="1">
           <li><span class="c4">Applicable Terms.</span>
             <span>Local Services by Google is a platform provided by Google Ireland Limited (registered number: 368047) with its registered office located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“<span class="cb">Google</span>” or “<span class="cb">we</span>”) that allows eligible businesses to advertise their services, and enables consumers to contact service providers directly through the ad. In these Local Services Additional Terms for Providers (“<span class="cb">Local Services Additional Terms</span>”),  “<span class="cb">you</span>” means you, as the individual or entity using the Local Services platform and offering and providing Services, and “<span class="cb">customer</span>” means your customer. Your use of the Local Services platform is governed by: (A) <a href="https://payments.google.com/payments/paymentsinfofinder?hostOrigin=aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXltZW50cy5nb29nbGUuY29tOjQ0MDY.&sri=-21" target="_blank">the Google Advertising Programme Terms</a> in effect between you and Google (“<span class="cb">Google Advertising Terms</span>”); (B) these Local Services Additional Terms, which are an addendum to the Google Advertising Programme Terms; and (C) the Local Services Platform Policies at <a href="http://www.google.com/homeserviceads/policies" target="_blank">www.google.com/homeserviceads/policies</a>, which may be revised by Google from time to time subject to providing such notice as required by applicable law, (the “<span class="cb">Local Services Platform Policies</span>”). The Google Advertising Programme Terms, Local Services Additional Terms, and the Local Services Platform Policies are collectively referred to as the “<span class="cb">Terms</span>.” Words or phrases that are capitalised but not defined in these Local Services Additional Terms are defined in the Google Advertising Programme Terms. With respect to your Use of the Local Services platform, if any term or provision of these Local Services Additional Terms differs from a corresponding term or provision in the Google Advertising Programme Terms, the term or provision in these Local Services Additional Terms will apply to Use of the Local Services platform. The Local Services platform is a “<span class="cb">Programme</span>" as defined in the Google Advertising Programme Terms. You must ensure that the members of your Team comply with the Terms, when they participate in the provision of Services. Your “<span class="cb">Team</span>” means you, and your employees, contractors (including subcontractors), workers, representatives that provide Services.</span>
             <p><span>To Use the Local Services platform, you must agree to the Terms. If you do not accept the Terms, you may not Use the Local Services platform.</span></p>
             <p><span>If you use other Google products or services, then the terms for those other products or services will also apply. These Terms are separate from any additional terms that may apply between you and the third-party website through which you access the Local Services platform, and/or you and a customer, and Google does not have any liability to you with respect to those terms. You agree that you will require your Team to comply with the Terms, and you are responsible if any of your Team does not comply with the Terms.</span></p>

         <ol start="2">
           <li><span class="c4">Program Requirements.</span><span>   Your Use of the Local Services platform must be in accordance with the Terms.</span></li>
           <li><span class="c4">Minimum Provider Requirements and Warranties.</span><span>In order to use the Local Services platform, you and your Team must comply with the “Minimum Provider Requirements,” as described in the Local Services Platform Policies. You warrant that: (i) all of the information that you provide to Google or third parties in connection with the Local Services platform is complete, correct, current and accurate; (ii) you and your Team have satisfied the Minimum Provider Requirements prior to providing the Services and will remain compliant for the duration of these Terms; (iii) if any member of your Team has not completed any verification process required by Google, that member of your Team will not be sent to any engagement acquired by you through the Local Services platform; and (iv) you and your Team will comply with applicable laws at all times. All third-party verification processes are conducted solely to confirm compliance with the Minimum Provider Requirements, and are not used for any other purpose. You and your Team may be required to recertify your compliance with the Minimum Provider Requirements from time to time, as described in the Local Services Platform Policies. Your access to the Local Services platform may be suspended if you fail to satisfy the Minimum Provider Requirements at any time.

           <li><span class="c4">Employment.</span><span>Employees of Google and its affiliates are prohibited from providing Services via the Local Services platform, serving on or contributing to your Team, or otherwise participating as a Service provider on the Local Services platform.

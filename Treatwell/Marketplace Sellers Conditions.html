<li><b>Service descriptions.</b> We may provide two services which will be itemised on your relevant Specific Partner Agreement:
<ol>
<li><b>Salon Software:</b> Our software-powered Salon diary management system with a range of features to help you manage and grow your business. This Software includes certain Point of Sale tools which you can utilise to augment your business presence. Such Software includes the use of Treatwell APIs (<b>API</b>) which mean (i) any form of machine accessible application programming interface that Treatwell makes available which provides access to a Treatwell System, including all associated tools, elements, components and executables therein, (ii) any Treatwell sample code that enables interactions with a Treatwell System, and (iii) documentation that Treatwell makes available to help enable your access to the Treatwell APIs. As we are constantly improving our Software provided to you, we reserve the right to change any Software capabilities including but not limited to those changes that result in subordination or cessation of the current Software</li>
<li><b>Marketplace:</b> Our booking platform on our website (<a class="externallink" href="https://www.treatwell.co.uk" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.treatwell.co.uk">www.treatwell.co.uk</a>) and app (downloadable by Customers) that advertises your services to a wide range of potential Customers. Within the Marketplace, we also offer:
<ol>
<li>Partner Page. A customisable website featuring your services hosted either at a unique subdomain address on mytreatwell.co.uk or (if we agree) on your own domain.</li>
<li>Widget. A widget which you can add to your social media, website and Partner Page that allows Customers to book appointments. We offer:
<ol>
<li>Prepaid Widget Bookings that allow Customers to make Bookings and pay online at the same time.</li>
<li>Pay Later Widget Bookings that allow Customers to make Bookings online at your venue without paying upfront.</li></ol></li>
<li>Third Party Technology Providers. Access to third party technology such as Reserve with Google, Google maps or Apple maps where your Salon may be displayed.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li>
<li><u><b>SALON SOFTWARE</b></u>
<ol>
<li><b>Licence.</b>Where you’ve purchased Salon Software, we grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and fully revocable licence to use our Software, as applicable to you.</li>
<li><b>Admin access.</b>We use third party vendors to provide us technology to run Salon Software. This means we have administrator access to all parts of the Salon Software, including those which have been specifically tailored to you, and that we’ll track your use of the Salon Software using third party tools to help us understand how it’s used and how we can improve it. You agree that you have no right to any tracking data and can’t access it or opt out of tracking.</li></ol></li>
<li><u><b>MARKETPLACE</b></u>
<ol>
<li><b>Bookings.</b> Customers can book your services (each, a Booking) on our Marketplace through the Website or App, the website we have customised for you (Partner Page), via our affiliates’ and other third party channels that we use to advertise your services (Distribution Channels), or via Google’s booking platform. ​​Customers can also book your services via the provided prepaid or pay later Widgets.
<ol>
<li><b>Booking charges.</b> For each type of Booking:
<ol>
<li>Commission which is an amount payable by you to us for a New Booking. The Commission payable is specified in your Specific Partner Agreement and can be amended by us from time to time. Unless you’ve flagged a &#34;no show&#34; on the Salon Software by midnight on the appointment date, we’ll treat a Booking as fulfilled and we’ll be entitled to Commission, and</li>
<li>a Processing Fee (which means any fees charged for processing card payments). Which charges apply are specified in your Specific Partner Agreement. </li></ol></li>
<li><b>New and Repeat Bookings.</b> A <b>New Booking</b> is where a Customer:
<ol>
<li>doesn’t exist in your customer database within our Software (<b>Customer Database</b>) by name and additional unique identifiers such as email address or phone number,</li>
<li>was added to your Customer Database more than 365 days ago, but hasn’t had a Booking where you successfully provided your services to them (<b>a Successful Appointment</b>) in the last 365 days, or</li>
<li>was added to your Customer Database less than 365 days ago as a result of an appointment which wasn’t or hasn’t yet become a Successful Appointment.<br/><br/> All other Bookings are considered Repeat Bookings and won’t be subject to Commission.</li>
<li><b>Customer duplicates.</b> If a Customer (identified by their first name and either email address or phone number) is duplicated in the Customer Database, the most recent Successful Appointment will be used to determine whether a Booking is a New Booking or Repeat Booking.</li>
<li><b>Discrepancies.</b> In the event of any discrepancies between our and your Customer Database regarding New or Repeat Bookings, you may provide quantitative and qualitative evidence that can sufficiently prove the customer was a Repeat Customer within 60 days of the relevant repeat appointment and we will decide not to apply commission at our sole discretion.</li></ol></li>
<li><b>Booking terms.</b> When a Customer makes a Booking using any method (except the Pay Later Widget), you agree to comply with terms relevant to you in the Booking Terms and Conditions.</li>
<li><b>Booking obligations.</b> You must accept all Bookings and can only reject a Booking in exceptional circumstances, which you must notify us about in writing. </li>
<li><b>Cancellations.</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Refunds.</b> If we’re required by law or your cancellation policy to refund a Customer or if you have acted contrary to these Terms, we may require you to repay us for this refund and any reasonable expenses related to it. You agree to share your cancellation policy with each Customer at the time of the Booking. If you fail to do so we may require you to repay us for any refund owed to the Customer.</li>
<li>With respect to Marketplace Bookings and Prepaid Widget Bookings, you are obliged to comply with the cancellation and modification policy stipulated in our Booking Terms and Conditions. We and/or you will offer a refund for Marketplace Bookings and Prepaid Widget Bookings which are cancelled (or cannot be rescheduled) provided the relevant appointment is scheduled outside your notified cancellation policy.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
<li><b>Reviews and Rankings.</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Rankings.</b> When a potential Customer searches for a service on the Marketplace, they’ll see a list of our partners in the search results. The ranking depends on various factors to help potential Customers find the most appropriate services for them.</li>
<li><b>Sorting results.</b> Potential Customers can also sort their search results by certain filters visible on our Marketplace.<br/><br/><b>Customer Reviews.</b> The Marketplace allows Customers to leave reviews about your services (<b>Customer Reviews</b>), which you can access at any time. We aren’t liable to you for any type of loss connected to a Customer Review and you understand that Customer Reviews may contain negative feedback about you and your services. You agree that you have no rights in Customer Reviews and Replies and aren’t entitled to copies upon termination of your Account.</li>
<li><b>Replies.</b> You may reply to any Customer Reviews expressly mentioning their experience with you, but all replies must follow our <a class="externallink" href="https://www.treatwell.co.uk/info/community-guidelines/" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.treatwell.co.uk/info/community-guidelines/">Review Guidelines.</a></li>
<li><b>Amending reviews.</b> We may request to review your replies before or after they’re published. Any changes we make to a reply must be incorporated into the published version, and you agree we may remove any of your replies at any time as we see fit.</li>
<li><b>Defamatory or Inaccurate Reviews.</b> If you believe a Customer Review contains defamatory language about you and/or your services or violates your or another party’s rights, you may report this to us. We may investigate this and take any actions we believe to be appropriate to amend or remove the Customer Review. The decisions made by us will be final. You may contact Customers who leave Customer Reviews only in the review platform and through no other means of contact.</li></ol></li></ol></li>

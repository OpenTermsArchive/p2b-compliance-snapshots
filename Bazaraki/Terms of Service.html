<ul>
	<li>Request Access: You have the right to request access to your Personal Data.</li>
	<li>Request to Correct Personal Data: You may request that we correct any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
	<li>Request to Erase Personal Data: You may request that we delete or remove any Personal Data where there is no valid legal basis for us continuing to process it. We may not always be able to comply with your request due to legal requirements that will be notified to you at the relevant time.</li>
	<li>Object to Processing of Personal Data: Where there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing because it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information.</li>
	<li>Request Restriction of Processing: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data if you want us to establish the data&rsquo;s accuracy or where the use of such data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it or where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
	<li>Request the Transfer of Personal Data: You may request that we provide you, or a third party of your choice, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used to perform a contract with you.</li>

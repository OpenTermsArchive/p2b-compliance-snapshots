12.4. The above limitations of liability shall also apply in favor of the legal representatives and employees or a person having performed an obligation of TRIVAGO.</p><p> 
12.5.

14.3. The right to terminate the Terms extraordinarily for good cause without notice (e.g. violation of confidentiality, breach of law, delayed or non-payment for Paid Apps, legal or regulatory obligation) remains unaffected.

17.7. Severability</p><p>
Should any provision of the Terms or any provision which is incorporated in it at a later point in time be or become invalid or unenforceable, either wholly or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms. The same shall apply if the Terms are found to have a gap concerning the matters to be provided for. To replace such invalid or unenforceable provision or to fill such gap, an adequate provision shall be incorporated which, to the extent this is legally feasible, will approximate as closely as possible what parties hereto had intended or would have intended with a view to the meaning and purpose of the Terms, if they had considered this particular question at the time of the conclusion of the business relationship or of the later incorporation of a provision.</p><p>

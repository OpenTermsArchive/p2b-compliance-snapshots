<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Fyndiq and sales via our Sites, an upselling channel for bargains. Fyndiq now offers Sites and upselling channels in the Nordic countries Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.</p>
<p>In order for customers to be satisfied, all elements need to be right: from Your purchase of a product, to Your posting of a Product Advertisement, until You deliver the product to the consumer. Our cooperation is important and entails both legal rights and legal obligations. Therefore, please take the time to read these General Terms and Conditions for Merchants carefully.</p>
<p>Fyndiq works on a so-called Flash-Sale-Model. When an order is placed by a customer, Fyndiq buys the product from You (in a “flash”) and sells the product to the customer. This means Fyndiq is always the merchant of contract for the customer. Fyndiq will be the party invoicing the customer, will handle payments from the customer and settlement to You. Further, Fyndiq functions as the first line of contact with the customer and also owns the relationship to the customer. You acknowledge and accept that the customers who shop on the Sites are Fyndiq's customers.</p>
<p>It's important to always focus on the "customer experience". This is not as fuzzy a concept as it might sound. We mean that You must always ensure that information which You provide about the product in both the Product Advertisement and at the time of delivery is attractively presented, complete, and understandable to the consumer. Just ask Yourself – would I want, or be able, to buy the product if I received this information? It is, of course, obvious that the product cannot be a pirate copy, and must be legal and safe to use.</p>
<p>Remember that only professional merchants may sell via Fyndiq. In the event You are private person, You must find another way to sell Your products.<br><br><strong>2. Definitions</strong></p>
<p>The "Agreement" means the terms covered by Your registration process via Help Center, and these general terms and conditions, the appendices set out in section 3 and Fyndiq's Guidelines.</p>
<p>"Fyndiq" means Fyndiq AB, reg. no 556792-1712.</p>
<p>“Guidelines” means Fyndiq’s Guidelines, as applicable from time to time, in Help Center, such as Fyndiq’s price policy, Guidelines on Prohibited Products and Guidelines on Service Fees.</p>
<p>“Help Center” is the portal where You find Fyndiq’s Guidelines, please see https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/.</p>
<p>“Market(s)” are the market or markets in which Fyndiq from time to time offers its e-commerce platforms, currently in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.</p>
<p>“Merchant Performance Report / MPR” is a report that Fyndiq establishes for comparison purposes in order to improve the customer experience.</p>
<p>“Part / Parties” are You and Fyndiq individually or jointly.</p>
<p>"Product Advertisement" means product information for publication on the Site, e.g. pictures, text, and graphics.</p>
<p>"Site(s)" means Fyndiq's web-based e-commerce platforms with different domains for different Markets, including Fyndiq's websites, applications, software, and content.</p>
<p>"You / Your" means You, a so-called trader, with a tax clearance certificate and a VAT registration number, and who registers a user account on the Site.<br><br><strong>3. Scope</strong></p>
<p>The Agreement between You and Fyndiq covers Your registration process via Help Center and the following documents: i) these General Terms and Conditions, ii) Fyndiq’s Guidelines, and iii) specifically set up appendices**.</p>
<p>** The specifically set up appendices are the following:<br>Appendix 1 – Prohibited Products<br>Appendix 2 – Personal data policy<br>Appendix 3 – Data Processing Agreement<br>Appendix 4 – Handling of certain common customer service matters<br>Appendix 5 – Fyndiq’s Special Terms and Conditions for Merchants supplying goods from non-EU member states</p>
<p>The documents are intended to complement each other. Nevertheless, in the event of contradictions, Appendix 5 shall take precedence over these General Terms and Conditions and these General Terms and Conditions shall take precedence over Appendices 1-4 in the above order. Further, Appendices 1-4 shall prevail over Fyndiq’s Guidelines.<br><br><strong>4. User account and access to the Sites</strong></p>
<p>When You register a user account on the Site, You approve, and enter into, the Agreement with Fyndiq.</p>
<p>Fyndiq owns and controls the Sites and user accounts. You undertake to comply with Fyndiq's Guidelines for user accounts and the Sites. Any information which You provide to Fyndiq must always be correct and current.</p>
<p>In the context of establishing Fyndiq’s MPR, Fyndiq is entitled to investigate matters related to e.g. uncollected products, missing products and/or returned products. MPR is made in order to, inter alia, establish certain thresholds for customer service issues/matters that shall not be exceeded by You. Such thresholds are determined by Fyndiq in its sole discretion and communicated from time to time via Fyndiq’s Guidelines under “Information about thresholds”, which You can find <a href="https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/en-se/articles/360037937731-Information-about-thresholds" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all activity on Your user account (and for taking security measures to prevent unauthorised use). You are responsible for Your personnel and consultants at all times.</p>
<p>You are obligated, on Your own initiative, to regularly check modifications of the Agreement and Fyndiq's General Terms and Conditions for Consumers. Modifications enter into force fourteen (14) days after Fyndiq has given notice thereof, for example in Help Center.</p>
<p>Fyndiq may immediately restrict or shut down Your Product Advertisements, user accounts, or activity on the Sites if You breach the Agreement, or laws and regulations. Examples of this include if:<br>(i) there is a risk of infringement of intellectual property rights or a risk of product liability;<br>(ii) You lack a valid tax clearance certificate or relevant registration with a public agency, or You are investigated by an agency for unlawful activities, inadequate accounting, payment of taxes or social insurance charges;<br>(iii) You provide inaccurate or misleading information about You and Your business;<br>(iv) You are in bankruptcy, have commenced composition proceedings, have suspended Your payments, or can otherwise be deemed to be insolvent;<br>(v) You behave inappropriately or threateningly towards Fyndiq's personnel, consumers, or other merchants;<br>(vi) there is a risk that You will cause Fyndiq to incur financial loss or legal liability (liability which Fyndiq did not expressly undertake pursuant to the Agreement).<br>(vii) Your values in comparison with MPR exceed certain thresholds, caused by e.g. an excessive number of missing products, complaints etc.<br><br><strong>5. Products sold on the Sites</strong></p>
<p><em>Generally</em></p>
<p>You understand and accept that Fyndiq sells the products to consumers and that consumer protection laws and regulations for each Market apply to all sales which take place on the Sites. You select which Markets You want Fyndiq to sell Your Products on.</p>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring that products which are marketed and delivered meet requirements for quality, public safety, labelling, instructions for use, and warnings pursuant to laws, regulations, and Fyndiq's Guidelines. You understand and accept that You must personally check and ascertain that products comply with laws and regulations for each Market, e.g. that product information, warnings, and labels must be written in the local language when required.</p>
<p>In the event a product or Product Advertisement uses any third party's intellectual property rights, You are responsible for ensuring that necessary consent has been obtained from the rights holders. As a merchant, You must actively endeavor to prevent the sale of pirated copies via Fyndiq.</p>
<p>Since consumers who purchase on the Sites are Fyndiq's customers, You may not use customer information:</p>
<p>(i) to send documents with a delivery, to send a separate mail-out, or to design packaging or Product Advertisements which directly or indirectly market Your own or another party's business, products, or services;<br>(ii) to make direct contact via, e.g., email, text messages, social media, or telephone; or<br>(iii) to send an invoice or make another demand to the customer.</p>
<p>You may not market or deliver products which are included in Appendix 1 – Prohibited Products to this Agreement and listed in Fyndiq’s Guidelines under “Prohibited Products”, which You can find <a href="https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/en-se/articles/360037935451-Prohibited-Products" target="_self">here</a>.<br><br><em>Advertisements and pricing</em></p>
<p>You undertake to provide complete product information so that consumers can make a well-informed choice. The Product Advertisement may not be erroneous or misleading. You undertake to correct errors or flaws immediately, and immediately notify Fyndiq of any significant corrections that have been made.</p>
<p>Pictures in Product Advertisements must be professional quality and clearly show the actual product which is being sold. Use of pictures and other graphics in a Product Advertisement must comply with Fyndiq's Guidelines.</p>
<p>You must for each selected Market state a recommended price to consumers and an ordinary market price for the product, in local currency with the correct VAT rate for the applicable Market, so that Fyndiq has a basis for the pricing. Fyndiq may temporarily or permanently increase or decrease the sales price to the consumer (but You will always receive Your compensation based on Your recommended price), as further specified in the section Fyndiq’s service fees, Your compensation and payment (<a href="https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/en-se/articles/360037566952-Service-Fees" target="_self">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fyndiq reserves the right to at any given time block a product from being sold on one or several of the Sites if Fyndiq considers the price too high in relation to the same or a similar product that can be found on that Market. More information on this can be found in Fyndiq’s Guidelines under “Fyndiq’s price policy”, which You can find <a href="https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/en-se/articles/360037567572-Fyndiq-s-price-policy" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>When You post a Product Advertisement, You must bear in mind that You may only post one advertisement per Market for a specific product (however, if two or more products are bundled into a separate offer, such a product may be included).</p>
<p>Fyndiq has the exclusive right to make changes to each Product Advertisement, apart from Your obligation to make corrections.<br><br><em><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Sales and marketing</span></em></p>
<p>You may only post Product Advertisements for products that are unused, in working condition, and free of defects. The original packaging must be in good condition.</p>
<p>Fyndiq markets and sells only factory-new products, unless we have agreed otherwise. In certain cases, Fyndiq may provide written approval prior to sale of products from bankruptcy stocks, demonstration models, products which You or another party have repaired/renovated, or products for which You otherwise believe You have limited liability, provided this is lawful under applicable consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>Fyndiq may remove a product from a Site at any time whatsoever, e.g. if the product is not sold within a specific time from publication of the advertisement, or if Fyndiq decides that the product does not comply with laws, regulations, or Fyndiq's Guidelines.<br><br><em>Stocks and delivery</em></p>
<p>Products which Fyndiq sells on the Sites must be maintained in stock by You or Your suppliers in an EU/EEA member state. You bear full responsibility for any shortages at Your suppliers. You are responsible for ensuring that products available for sale on the Sites are also in stock or otherwise can be delivered on time.</p>
<p>You are responsible for direct delivery of the product to the consumer within the delivery time stated in Fyndiq's General Terms and Conditions for Consumers (or another delivery time which applies to certain products pursuant to written agreement with Fyndiq and of which the consumer has been informed prior to the purchase).</p>
<p>You are responsible for the product until the consumer has received it. Notification to the consumer that the product has been sent or can be collected from the collection point, or the consumer's failure to collect the package, does not change Your liability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web Scraping/crawling</p>
<p>All automatic data collection from any of the Fyndiq-sites (fyndiq.se, fyndiq.dk, fyndiq.fi, fyndiq.no) is forbidden, including scraping and crawling, for the purpose of using the data to upload it again on the site (s). If this is discovered, you as a merchant can be fined a fee per uploaded unique article (including variations) as well as being terminated immediately.</p>
<p>The use of automated systems or software to extract data from any Fyndiq-sites (fyndiq.se, fyndiq.dk, fyndiq.fi, fyndiq.no) for commercial purposes, (‘screen scraping’) is prohibited unless the third party has directly concluded a written license agreement with Fyndiq/CDON in which permits it access to the site (s).</p>
<p><br><br><strong>6. Customer service and product liability</strong></p>
<p><em>Support and customer service</em></p>
<p>As a merchant, You are responsible for assisting our customers regarding complaints, regrets and missing products ordered via Your Product Advertisement. In all other cases, contact with customers will be handled by Fyndiq's customer service. If necessary, we will contact and inform You in matters concerning Your products. The most common issue types are presented in the Appendix 4 – How to handle certain issue types.</p>
<p>You must respond to incoming matters within 24 hours during weekdays in the relevant Market. If You do not respond in time, Fyndiq will make decisions how the matters will be solved. You commit to answering Fyndiq’s, and our consumer's, questions as fully as possible and to propose a suitable solution in accordance with laws, regulations and Fyndiq's General Terms and Conditions for Consumers. Fyndiq reserves the right to make decisions how the matters will be solved.</p>
<p>When You receive or collect a returned product, You must notify Fyndiq and the consumer respectively immediately or not later than within 48 hours. You must collect a product within 24 hours on a weekday in the relevant Market, excluding public holidays, from the date on which You received notification.</p>
<p>Fyndiq may invoice You (or make a deduction prior to payment of Your compensation to You) for refunds to consumers (complaints, missing products etc.) and other actual costs which Fyndiq incurs in connection with handling customer service matters. For the avoidance of doubt, You approve that e.g. discount codes and suchlike, which Fyndiq provides as a customer care gesture, are an actual cost.</p>
<p>In the event Fyndiq needs to invoice or otherwise charge for a cost which the consumer is required to bear pursuant to law or Fyndiq's General Terms and Conditions for Consumers for the relevant Market, You understand and accept that You may only receive Your compensation if Fyndiq actually receives payment from the consumer. Since the customers belong to Fyndiq, only Fyndiq may invoice or otherwise charge the customer. Fyndiq has a right, but no obligation, to escalate such matters to debt collectors, the Swedish Enforcement Authority or suchlike.</p>
<p>Except cases regarding complaints, regrets and missing products, You can in exceptional cases after Fyndiq's written approval also handle other consumer cases.</p>
<p>In connection with complaint and warranty matters, You are only entitled to charge a troubleshooting fee if doing so is reasonable (depending on product type and price) pursuant to Fyndiq's Guidelines.</p>
<p>You understand and accept that You may not encourage a customer to send a product to Fyndiq's address.</p>
<p>Fyndiq views fraud and attempted fraud seriously. Fyndiq cooperates with the police, public agencies, and payment service providers. We expect Your prompt and effective assistance when we request it, e.g. when dispatch of a product must be stopped. Fyndiq has a Fraud Policy which is set forth in Fyndiq’s Guidelines under “Fraud Policy”, which You can find <a href="https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/en-se/articles/360037937711-Fraud-Policy" target="_self">here</a>. You understand and accept that a product which is sent as "non- trackable" (i.e. without a trackable sending number/ID or registered letter) always takes place at Your own risk.<br><br><em>Product liability and monitoring</em></p>
<p>Selling consumer products entails significant responsibility. You are liable for any claims from rights holders, consumers, and public agencies (including administrative fines or fees) which relate to Your products or Product Advertisements in the relevant Market.</p>
<p>Your products and Product Advertisements must be legal, meet product safety requirements, and have the permits, warranties, and completed tests by the producers or notified bodies which are necessary pursuant to laws and regulations in the relevant Market. In the event Fyndiq contacts You, You must respond within 48 hours on weekdays in the relevant market, excluding public holidays, and send relevant certificates, information, and documents to Fyndiq, e.g. CE labelling, EU assurances regarding compliance, proof of product labelling, EAN, article and batch number.</p>
<p>In the event a public agency, rights holder, or organization requires that the manufacture, import, or sale of a product must be reported or accounted for, or if the product must be recalled, You are responsible for doing so in accordance with laws and regulations. You are liable for all costs and payment of any related compensation or fees.</p>
<p>You are responsible for fulfilling any obligations regarding reporting and payment of fees for recycling, waste management of products, product parts (e.g. batteries) and packaging in the relevant Market.</p>
<p>Fyndiq regularly monitors compliance of Product Advertisements and products with the Agreement, laws, and regulations. Fyndiq may also receive claims from, e.g., rights holders, their legal counsel, or public agencies. You undertake to respond to our questions as completely as possible and to send us relevant certificates, documentation, or pictures. Ordinarily, You must respond to matters which Fyndiq sends to You within 48 hours on weekdays, excluding public holidays, in the relevant Market. You understand and accept that if Fyndiq determines that there is a risk of financial or legal liability, the Product Advertisement or Fyndiq’s sale of Your products may be stopped immediately.<br><br><strong>7. Fyndiq’s service fees, Your compensation and payment</strong></p>
<p>Fyndiq handles sales to consumers, presentation of Product Advertisements, and other functions on the Sites, including payment. In addition, Fyndiq may market and conduct sales of products (which Fyndiq selects), both through Fyndiq's own marketing and through purchases of advertisements and search results via other platforms, e.g. GoogleAds.</p>
<p>Fyndiq charges a service fee for the services which Fyndiq offers. Fyndiq's service fees are: (i) "Selling Fee", which is a percentage fee of Your recommended price for the product; and (ii) "Category Fee", which depends on the product category. Current service fees are set forth in Fyndiq’s Guidelines under “Service Fees”, which You can find <a href="https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/en-se/articles/360037566952-Service-Fees" target="_self">here</a>. In case of changes of Fyndiq’s service fees, You will be notified via e-mail at the latest two weeks before the change enters into force.</p>
<p>Fyndiq pays Your compensation for a sold product, after deducting the Selling Fee, the Category Fee, and any costs which Fyndiq incurs and for which You are responsible pursuant to the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, please note that the Fyndiq service fees are non-refundable. In order to receive Your compensation, You must provide us with a valid International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), and/or postgiro and/or bankgiro, as applicable.</p>
<p>Laws and regulations provide that a consumer may often make a complaint in respect of a product long after delivery. In the event Fyndiq is obligated to pay a refund to a consumer for a product (or for any other claims) but You have already received Your compensation for the product, Fyndiq shall be entitled to set off such amounts from subsequent compensation to You or invoice You for such amounts. In addition, Fyndiq shall be entitled to deduct costs retroactively, e.g. any differences for incorrect VAT rates set by You for the relevant Market and either set off such amounts or claim such amounts.</p>
<p>Fyndiq is entitled to refuse to pay Your Compensation if You breach the Agreement or if the consumer exercises its right of withdrawal or its right to return the product within 30 days of receipt.<br><br><strong>8. Intellectual property rights</strong></p>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring that Your products and Product Advertisements do not infringe upon Fyndiq’s or a third party’s intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>When You upload a Product Advertisement, You grant Fyndiq an exclusive right to use the Product Advertisement, free of charge, in whole or in part, during such time as the product is marketed on any Site. This includes an exclusive right for Fyndiq to make the changes and adjustments in the Product Advertisement that may be required under the Agreement, e.g. by translating the Product Advertisement into local languages for different Markets, and to use the Product Advertisement in marketing for Fyndiq's own business and to sublicense to a third party. You may not use translated or otherwise adjusted Product Advertisements on other marketplaces or on Your own website during the time that the product is marketed on any Site. However, You still have an obligation to correct errors or flaws in a Product Advertisement and immediately notify Fyndiq of any significant corrections that have been made.</p>
<p>You may not use intellectual property rights belonging to Fyndiq without Fyndiq's prior written approval.<br><br><strong>9. Disclosure obligation</strong></p>
<p>You shall inform Fyndiq immediately:</p>
<p>(i) where You or a company upstream in the sales chain (wholesaler, retailer, distributor, manufacturer, etc.) is placed into bankruptcy, commences composition proceedings, is placed into liquidation, or can otherwise be deemed to be insolvent, or if there is otherwise a risk that warranty liability or product liability will not be satisfied;<br>(ii) in the event of any suspected or determined infringement of intellectual property rights; or<br>(iii) of any circumstances which may entail a risk of legal liability or financial liability for Fyndiq or for You, e.g. in respect of product safety, health, or the environment.<br><br><strong>10. Personal data</strong></p>
<p>You undertake to inform employees and other representatives that their personal data may be processed as part of the Agreement and to provide a copy or reference to Fyndiq’s personal data policy which constitutes Appendix 2 to this Agreement.</p>
<p>To the extent that You process personal data in the capacity of personal data processor on behalf of Fyndiq, the Parties have entered into a Data Processing Agreement which is attached as Appendix 3 to this Agreement and which specifically regulate the Parties’ respective responsibilities for such processing of personal data.<br><br><strong>11. Liability in damages</strong></p>
<p>You are liable for damage and claims for damages arising from Your product, Product Advertisement, unlawful use of Personal Data, or Your failure otherwise to perform Your obligations under the Agreement. You shall indemnify Fyndiq in the event of claims from third parties, for example consumers, legal entities, private organisations, or public agencies made towards Fyndiq. For the avoidance of doubt, Your liability for loss also includes a consumer's right in certain cases, to bring claims against a trader in the upstream sales chain due to defects in the product. For the avoidance of doubt, You understand and are aware that the liability of Fyndiq towards for example consumers, legal entities, private organisations, or public agencies are completely back-to-back in all aspects with Your liability towards Fyndiq.</p>
<p>In the event of any technical or handling defects, Fyndiq shall not be liable for lost sales, costs, or any damage which may arise as a result.</p>
<p>In the event Fyndiq is involved in a civil dispute regarding Your product, or Your Product Advertisement, or if Your Product or Product Advertisement infringes a third party's individual property rights, You shall immediately assist Fyndiq during the dispute and indemnify Fyndiq for damages, compensation for infringement and all direct and indirect costs (including reasonable legal fees) which arise, or which Fyndiq must pay in connection with the dispute or the infringement. This includes, but is not limited to, a right for Fyndiq to invoice You if the dispute or the infringement results in an obligation for Fyndiq to compensate a third party as a result of a settlement.</p>
<p>In the event Your product has been sold on Fyndiq’s platform and the product is considered not to be safe or is considered dangerous according to what is set out in the law, e.g. in the Product Safety Act (Sw. Produktsäkerhetslagen (2004:451)), You shall immediately assist Fyndiq with recalling Your product and any other measures related thereto, including information to consumers and authorities, and pay Fyndiq for all direct and indirect costs (including reasonable legal fees) which arise, or which Fyndiq must pay in connection herewith. This includes, but is not limited to, a right for Fyndiq to invoice You if the sale of Your product results in Fyndiq being obliged to pay penalty or sanction charges, or if the dispute results in Fyndiq being obliged to pay damages or other compensation.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach of contract, Fyndiq's right to demand that You perform the Agreement and to seek damages shall not be affected by Fyndiq taking, or not taking, other measures (e.g. restricting or shutting off Your Product Advertisements or user accounts).</p>
<p>You shall fully indemnify and hold Fyndiq harmless against any and all loss, liability, damage and/or cost that Fyndiq incurs as a result of or in connection with:</p>
<p>(i) transactions that are processed by an external payment provider or that otherwise result from Your provision of goods to the customer (including without limitation refunds and chargebacks);<br>(ii) the imposition of fines or penalties due to third party claims against an external payment provider as a result of Your conduct;<br>(iii) allegations of fraud related to Your business.<br><br><strong>12. Term of the Agreement, termination and consequences of termination of the Agreement</strong></p>
<p>The Agreement is valid until further notice with one month’s notice of termination, and always applies if You have active Product Advertisements on any Site.</p>
<p>Each Party may terminate the Agreement with immediate effect if the other Party materially breaches its obligations under the Agreement (or an agreement with another company within the same group).</p>
<p>In the event one of the Parties is placed into bankruptcy, commences composition proceedings, is placed into liquidation, or may otherwise be deemed to be insolvent, the other Party may terminate the Agreement with immediate effect.</p>
<p>In the event a direct competitor of Fyndiq acquires participating interests, shares, or assets in Your business or otherwise provides funds or guarantees for Your business or a business in the corporate group to which You belong, Fyndiq shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Notice of termination shall be given in writing.</p>
<p>Due to their content, certain provisions will remain in force following termination of the Agreement, e.g. You must deliver products which have been sold to consumers, You must assist Fyndiq in customer service matters, You must assume Your product liability, and You must pay any damages.</p>
<p>Fyndiq may withhold Your outstanding payments for up to 60 days after the date of the last and final planned payment.<br><br><strong>13. Liability insurance</strong></p>
<p>You shall maintain appropriate liability insurance for Your business and Your liability under the Agreement. At Fyndiq's request, You shall send copies of insurance certificates.<br><br><strong>14. Assignment</strong></p>
<p>Fyndiq shall be entitled to assign all or part of the Agreement to a third party. The Agreement is personal to You, and therefore, You are not entitled to assign the Agreement to any third party without Fyndiq's prior written approval.<br><br><strong>15. Applicable law and disputes</strong></p>
<p>The Agreement shall be governed by Swedish law.</p>
<p>Disputes arising from the Agreement shall be determined by a court of general jurisdiction, with the Stockholm District Court as the court of first instance.</p>

<p>Fyndiq protects personal privacy. At Fyndiq, we process personal data for those customers and users who use our services and products. In terms of You, as a merchant, we conduct this processing to perform the Agreement which is in force between Fyndiq and You and/or based on a legitimate commercial interest of Fyndiq.</p>
<p>You must provide personal data in order to register a user account and use Fyndiq's services. This data is entirely necessary in order to enter into the Agreement and use Fyndiq's services. If personal data is not provided, Fyndiq will not be able to perform the Agreement. Fyndiq, of course, complies with the laws and regulations which apply to processing of personal data. Fyndiq has taken appropriate technical and organisational security measures (including confidentiality) in order to protect personal data against unauthorised access, modification, dissemination, and destruction.</p>
<p>The personal data is used in order to:</p>
<p>(i) administer and perform the Agreement with You;<br>(ii) sort out and solve any problems which may arise when You use our services and products;<br>(iii) send newsletters; and/or<br>(iv) provide data to cooperation partners, including those outside of the EU/EEA (see below).</p>
<p>Fyndiq may use various cooperation partners in order to perform our obligations to You. Our cooperation partners may enter into an agreement with Fyndiq so that we can ensure a high level of protection for, and correct processing of, Your personal data.</p>
<p>Where Fyndiq has a cooperation partner in a country outside of the EU/EEA, personal data may be transferred to such country that may not have the same level of protection for personal data. In order to protect Your personal data, Fyndiq enters into agreements with our cooperation partners which govern the transfer and each cooperation partner's personal data processing. Agreements contain the standard terms and conditions issued by the EU Commission and Fyndiq endeavors to ensure the personal data is processed in such way so as to meet applicable statutory requirements.</p>
<p>Fyndiq stores Your personal data for as long as is necessary in order to perform the Agreement. Fyndiq takes reasonable measures to keep processed personal data current and to remove noncurrent and otherwise erroneous or unnecessary personal data. Should the Agreement terminate, we will only continue to store Your personal data for such time as we have any obligation pursuant to law or to protect consumers' rights.</p>
<p>Fyndiq may use so-called web beacons (or "pixel tags") on certain websites. We do not ordinarily use them to identify individual users personally.

This information is used to improve Fyndiq's services. Web beacons do not, ordinarily, collect any information beyond that which is provided by Your Internet browser as a standard setting. You can choose not to accept cookies or web beacons; however, this may entail that the functionality of Fyndiq's Internet services will encounter problems.

<p>Fyndiq AB (company reg. no. 556792-1712) is responsible for the processing of personal data.

<p><strong>1. The most common issue types</strong></p>
<p>Some customer service issues are very common (see the list below) and we have therefore chosen that You can handle these issues by Yourself.

<p>• Regret<br>• Complaint – wrong product<br>• Missing product<br>• Unfetched parcel</p>
<p>There are many other types of issues. These are handled by Fyndiq's customer service and a good and constructive cooperation is important - in accordance with laws, regulations, The National Board for Consumer Disputes’ (ARN), courts’ and other alternative dispute resolution bodies’ practices.</p>
<p>In the event that You exceed the applicable thresholds in the MPR (Merchant Performance Report), Fyndiq has the right to refund customers the value of the product(s) they have purchased to the extent that they are affected by the issues that caused the thresholds in the MPR to be exceeded to an appreciable extent. Please refer to the relevant Fyndiq’s Guidelines for information about the applicable thresholds, as provided for under “Information about thresholds”, which You can find <a href="https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/en-se/articles/360037937731-Information-about-thresholds" target="_self">here</a>. In addition to the foregoing, Fyndiq may also undertake other measures, for example bulk solve customer service issues for the benefit of the customer, including blocking Your account and pausing planned payments for up to 2 weeks in the event that you violate the Agreement and/or if You exceed the applicable thresholds in the MPR.<br><br><strong>2. Right of withdrawal</strong></p>
<p>The right of withdrawal is a legal right for consumers. In the event the consumer exercises the right of withdrawal, Fyndiq may refund the entire price of the product and charge You for it. This also applies if the original packaging of the product is missing or destroyed. The right of withdrawal does however not apply if the original packaging of the product is sealed due reasons of health and hygiene in accordance with laws and practices.</p>
<p>In the event the value of the product declines because the consumer has used it to an extent greater than necessary in order to check its characteristics or functions, Fyndiq shall consult with You regarding a suitable price deduction, to the extent permitted according to applicable consumer protection laws.<br><br><strong>3. Returning a product – defective product</strong></p>
<p>If You want to perform an assessment of the complaint, You are responsible for issuing return labels or return envelopes. An assessment of complaint means that You investigate the defect on the product in more detail, the source of the defect and whether it can be fixed.</p>
<p>You are responsible for costs associated with returning a product, e.g. return shipping, and are also responsible for the product during transport to You. More information about how this works is available in Fyndiq’s Guidelines under “Complaint”, which You can find <a href="https://support.fyndiq.se/hc/en-se/articles/360048283232-Customer-service-handling-in-Reclaimit" target="_self">here</a>.<br><br><strong>4. Delay – late delivery or non-delivery</strong></p>
<p>You understand and accept that consumer law rules allow a customer to seek various remedies in the event of late delivery or non-delivery, e.g. damages and indemnification for costs charged by banks or creditors.<br><br><strong>5. Uncollected products</strong></p>
<p>In the event the consumer fails to collect the product and it is returned to You, Fyndiq will charge the consumer for the actual shipping cost, provided that You notify Fyndiq.</p>
<p>However, in the event the customer informs You that they did not receive notification and the product is returned, You will not receive any compensation.</p>
<p>Unless Fyndiq gives notice otherwise, You are entitled to sell the relevant product after You received the returned product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h_01HCY473P9PWMZW5FKQZ4TP5VD">Appendix 5 – Fyndiq’s Special Terms and Conditions for Merchants supplying goods from non-EU member states</h3>
<p><strong>1. Scope of Application</strong></p>

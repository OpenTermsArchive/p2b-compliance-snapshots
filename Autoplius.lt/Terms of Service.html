      <strong>Requirements for the content, form and other conditions of use of Autoplius.lt</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>By placing an Advertisement, the User assumes full responsibility for the compliance of its content with the Terms and Conditions and the legislation of the Republic of Lithuania. By submitting data in the Advertisement, the User confirms and warrants that the information provided is true, accurate and complete.</li>
        <li>Only Advertisements for the sale or rental of vehicles, their parts and/or accessories are permitted to be placed in the Website database. Users may not modify the basic information in their Advertisements after 24 hours of their posting: the make and/or model of the relevant vehicle.</li>
        <li>The advert must be placed only in the Autoplius.lt category for which it is intended (e.g. an advert for a used car cannot be placed in the motorcycle category).</li>
        <li>Only one object may be published (displayed and described) per Advertisement.</li>
        <li>Only one Advertisement of the same object can be placed and displayed on Autoplius.lt in the same category of advertisements.</li>
        <li>The Sold Vehicle Ad must be deleted. In this case, the remaining display time of the Advertisement will not be transferred to another Advertisement, nor can another object be placed in the existing Advertisement. In order to sell another object of the same make and model, a new Advertisement must be created. It is forbidden to place a new object on the basis of an old Advertisement.</li>
        <li>Depending on the selected Service Plan, the Entrepreneur Ads may additionally be placed on the Autoplius.lt partner's <a href="http://www.skelbiu.lt">www.skelbiu.lt</a> website with a special Autoplius.lt sign, thus indicating that the object is for sale on Autoplius.lt. By clicking on such an advertisement on <a href="http://www.skelbiu.lt">www.skelbiu.lt</a> the buyer is taken to the advertisement of the object on the Website.
        </li>
        <li>The user must not:
          <ol>
            <li>Offer in the Advertisement (comments, photos) objects or services other than those indicated in the main information of the Advertisement, provide false information about the characteristics of the advertised object;</li>
            <li>In the comments section of the advertisement, indicate a price different from that stated in the main information or a price that does not correspond to the actual market value. The price of the object in the Advertisement must include taxes. Ads that violate this prohibition are blocked;</li>
            <li>To provide information in the Advertisement and other Autoplius.lt environments that violates or may violate the applicable legislation of the Republic of Lithuania, contradicts generally accepted ethical or moral norms or does not comply with the requirements of these Rules;</li>
            <li>advertise, publish information that mentions third parties competing directly or indirectly with the Provider or their goods and/or services. The User agrees that such information/links may be removed;</li>
            <li>Offer in an advertisement an object that has been sold or that the User does not have the right to dispose of. The User placing the Advertisement must actually own the offered object. Ads that violate this prohibition will be blocked or moved to the bottom of the list of search results for Ads. The Website Administrator reserves the right to request proof of the User's right to dispose of the offered object;</li>
            <li>to place in place of photographs of the proposed object graphic images, letters, numbers, images of persons (e.g. logos, handwritten notes, telephone numbers, names) or a combination of photographs with graphic images, letters, numbers, logos, unrelated to the object of the advertisement. Photographs must reflect the object proposed in the Advertisement. Photographs may be edited by rotating them or changing the order of the photographs. Photographs that do not depict the object of the Advertisement, that depict persons, or that contain modified graphic images or logos may be deleted by the Website Administrator. The Website Administrator has the right to edit the photos, for example, by removing or obscuring the part of the photo that does not comply with the rules. The Website Administrator reserves the right to provide exceptions to this rule;</li>
            <li>to provide personal data, such as photographs of individuals or documents, in photographs of the object offered for sale, from which it would be possible to identify the current or former owners, users and other third parties unrelated to the advertisement. If there is a need to upload photographs of documents confirming compliance with the technical requirements of the object, such as a copy of a former registration certificate, it is up to the User to delete (erase, obscure) from these documents any personal data that can identify a specific natural person (e.g. names, surnames, personal identification numbers, dates of birth, addresses, photographs of persons or similar data).</li>
            <li>To place Adverts that express a wish to buy or offer only an exchange service, except for specific categories of Adverts (e.g. car buying, etc.).</li>

      <ol>
        <li>Payment for the Paid Services provided by Autoplius.lt shall be made by bank transfer, by SMS or by virtual credits - Autoplius.lt Pluses ("Plus"). Paid Services may be provided only after the User has paid for them in accordance with the procedure established by Autoplius.lt. The User shall be deemed to have paid for a Paid Service when the Provider actually receives the User's payment.</li>
        <li>Users may, for a fee, perform the following actions on the Website:
          <ol>
            <li>place Ads in paid Ad categories;</li>
            <li>Order additional Paid Services: ad highlighting, ad advertising, etc.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The price of paid services depends on the Service Plan, the time the Ad is displayed, the category of the Ad, and whether the User requests additional Services. The list of specific Paid Services, their prices and pricing terms, the procedure and terms of use of the Services are indicated on the Website, on the order page of each specific Paid Service, before payment. The full price list can also be found <a href="https://autoplius.lt/informacija/kainorastis/">here</a>. The User must familiarise himself with these Terms and Conditions before ordering the Services.
        </li>
        <li>Plus - virtual credits of Autoplius.lt, which the User can use to pay for the Services provided by Autoplius.lt. The cost of purchasing one Plus depends on the method of filling the Plus account. More detailed information about the methods of purchasing Pluses can be found in the "<a href="https://autoplius.lt/informacija/dazniausiai-uzduodami-klausimai">Frequently Asked Questions</a>" section of the Website and in the "Filling the Account" section of the User's logged-in environment. Pluses purchased by means other than those specified above (through third parties, etc.) are not valid and the Provider shall be entitled to cancel such User's Pluses and to claim compensation from the User for any losses incurred by the Provider.
        </li>
        <li>The prices for the placement of Ads and additional Services (highlighting, etc.) shall be specified in the Ads Placement Environment prior to ordering and in the <a href="https://autoplius.lt/informacija/dazniausiai-uzduodami-klausimai">Frequently Asked</a> Questions section of the Site.
        </li>
        <li>The Provider shall have the right to limit or discontinue the provision of the Services for a reasonable period of time during the preventive maintenance works on the Website, which are intended to ensure the proper functioning of the Website, taking into account the nature and importance of the works to be performed. In such case, the User using the Paid Services shall be informed of the commencement of the preventive works by e-mail and/or other notification at least 24 hours before the commencement of the works. The Provider may, but is not obliged to. extend the provision of the Paid Services to the User for the period during which the Paid Services have not been provided, or provide Paid Services similar to the unprovided Paid Services (provided that the Paid Services are not of a continuous nature) free of charge.</li>
        <li>In the event of restriction or suspension of the User's access to the Paid Services or the User's failure to receive or timely receive the Paid Services for reasons other than the User's violation of these Terms and Conditions and the cases referred to in the provisions of 3.2, 5.6, 11.1, the Provider shall, at the User's request, undertake to extend the provision of the Paid Services to the User for the period of time during which the Paid Services have not been provided, or to provide the Paid Services free of charge, analogous to the Paid Services not provided (provided that the Paid Services are not of a continuous nature).</li>
        <li>No refund is given for Ads that have been cancelled and/or removed due to the User's violation of these Terms and Conditions.</li>
        <li>One order for a Paid Service entitles the User to host one Advertisement, unless otherwise specified for a particular Service. By selecting a Paid Service under a specific plan and/or for a specific period of time (e.g., 30 days, etc.), the User undertakes to use this Service for at least the full duration of the Paid Service (the "Minimum Period"). If an Advert transaction takes place before the expiry of the Minimum Period (e.g. sale of a vehicle, etc.), or if the User cancels the Advert by himself, or if the Advert is cancelled due to the fault of the User, the money for the unused Minimum Period shall not be refunded to the User and shall not be transferred to the next Advert. After the transaction of the Ad has taken place, the User is obliged to remove the Ad in order not to mislead other Autoplius.lt visitors.</li>
        <li>If the User moves an Advertisement from active to passive, as well as if the display of the Advertisement is suspended due to the User's fault, the period of the Advertisement's non-display shall be counted towards the Minimum Period and the Minimum Period shall not be transferred and shall not be extended by the period of time during which the Advertisement was not publicly displayed on Autoplius.lt.</li>
        <li>Once an Ad transaction has taken place, the balance of the Minimum Period is not transferred to the next Ad and the User cannot publish a new Ad in place of the old Ad. If the User has adapted (intends to adapt) the Paid Service to a different Advertisement (for example, to a vehicle other than the original vehicle specified in the Advertisement), the Provider shall be entitled to cancel this Advertisement and warn the User or to charge for such Advertisement as if it were a new Advertisement. Such Advertisement shall only be displayed after proper payment has been made. If the User does not agree to pay, the Advertisement shall be cancelled.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>User's rights in the event of non-provision of Paid Services or in the event of inadequate quality of service provision</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>The User shall have the right to claim that the Provider commences the provision of the Paid Services if the Provider fails to comply with its obligation to commence the provision of the Paid Services purchased by the User immediately after the conclusion of the Contract, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. If, upon such demand, the Provider fails to provide the Paid Services immediately or within an additional period of time expressly agreed between the parties, the User shall have the right to unilaterally terminate the agreement for the provision of Paid Services.</li>
        <li>In the event of inadequate quality of the Paid Services, the User shall have the right to request the rectification of the defects in the Paid Services, a reduction in the price or unilateral termination of the contract.</li>
        <li>The User shall be entitled to have the defects in the Paid Service rectified, unless this is not possible or would result in disproportionate costs to the Provider taking into account all the circumstances, including:
          <ol>
            <li>The value of the paid service if there were no deficiencies;</li>
            <li>the significance of the deficiencies.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The User is entitled to a reduction in the price of the Paid Service or to unilateral termination of the contract in any of the following cases:
          <ol>
            <li>it is not possible for the Provider to remedy the deficiencies in the Paid Service, or the Provider would incur disproportionate costs in all the circumstances;</li>
            <li>The Provider has failed to remedy the deficiencies in the Paid Service within a reasonable period of time, free of charge and without significant inconvenience to the User, taking into account the nature of the Paid Service that made it necessary for the User;</li>
            <li>The deficiencies in the Paid Service occurred after the Provider had attempted to ensure that the Paid Service was of adequate quality;</li>
            <li>The flaw is fundamental;</li>
            <li>The Provider has stated or it has become apparent from the circumstances that it will not remedy the deficiencies in the Paid Service within a reasonable period of time, or that it will cause significant inconvenience to the User.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The User has the right to terminate the Contract only if the deficiency of the Paid Service is not minor.</li>
        <li>The User shall exercise his right to terminate the contract by submitting to the Provider a statement expressing his decision to terminate the contract for the provision of the Paid Services on the grounds of inadequate quality. Upon termination of the contract, the Provider shall refund to the User, within 14 days at the latest, all amounts paid by the User for the period during which the Paid Services were provided with inadequate quality, by the same method of payment used by the User to pay for the Paid Services.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consumer's right of withdrawal</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>The User confirms that he/she agrees that once the order has been placed, the additional Services ordered shall be deemed to have commenced and cannot be cancelled, and therefore the User agrees that he/she shall not be subject to the 14-day cancellation of the Distance Contract. Therefore, the User must assess the need for additional Services before ordering them. If the User removes an Advertisement by making it invisible (passive), the money for the additional Service ordered shall not be refunded and shall not be extended or transferred to another Advertisement.</li>
        <li>If the contract between the parties is terminated by the User through the fault of the User or on his/her own initiative before the expiry of the Minimum Period, the User shall be obliged to pay to the Provider a compensation equal to the portion of the fee for the particular Paid Service ordered by the User from the date of withdrawal until the end of the Minimum Period.This compensation shall be deducted from the price of the Paid Service paid by the User.This provision does not apply in the case of the User's withdrawal due to a change in the provision of the Paid Services, their non-delivery or inadequate quality, in accordance with the procedure of termination of the contract as laid down in Sections 2 and 6 of the Rules.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Warranty</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>The Provider reminds the User of the applicable legal guarantee of the quality of digital content and digital services.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Setting the rating</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Autoplius.lt's Ads search algorithm takes into account the following factors when generating Ads search results. It is designed to help Users find relevant Ads and may be personalised for each User of the Website based on factors such as, for example, keywords entered by the User in the search.</li>
        <li>The Site uses the following parameters in order of importance to rank the results of searches for Advertisements:
          <ol>
            <li>Autoplius.lt allows Users to purchase "Stars" before uploading an Ad. Ads with a higher number of purchased "Stars" are displayed higher in the search results. The number of "Stars" is indicated next to the name of such Ads. All Users may order "Stars" for an Advertisement: (i) by purchasing them individually; (ii) by obtaining a certain number of "Stars" together with the Advertisement activation package; or (iii) by purchasing a business plan with a "Star" automatically assigned to the Advertisements. This procedure is universal and there are no exceptions to this criterion for the selection of Ads;</li>
            <li>The ranking criteria for Ads without "Stars", or with the same number of "Stars", is indicated at the top of the Ads list, in the right-hand corner, taking into account the characteristics of the Ads as well as the search parameters set by the User, such as "Cheapest at the top", "Most expensive at the top", "Newest at the top", or "Top Update". The following exceptions and adjustments may also apply.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rating exceptions and additional conditions:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>In the category "Wheel rims", if you sort the Ads by price and if the prices are the same, the Ads which have been updated later are shown above.</li>
        <li>In categories where it is possible to specify that the price is negotiable, if you choose to sort by price, these Ads will be displayed below the Ads with the specified prices.</li>
        <li>After a keyword text search of the Ads, the Ads are ranked according to how closely they match the information entered by the User in the search, for example, whether the keyword was found in the headline or in the description of the Ad, how many times the keyword is repeated, etc.</li>
        <li>In the Car Parts category, if you select the Ads ranking method "New and updated at the top", the top of the search results will show the new Ads posted in the last 7 days by the date of update, and the remaining Ads by the date of update below.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>

Scope\n\nWe, Blacklane GmbH (\"Blacklane\"), take the protection of your personal data seriously and protect your privacy when processing them in accordance with the applicable data protection regulations.\n\nThis privacy policy informs you as a visitor of the Blacklane websites, as a user or customer of the online platform of Blacklane, a Blacklane App or other services of Blacklane (together also \"Blacklane Services\") which of your personal data is processed by Blacklane and for which purpose. The Blacklane Services are not aimed at minors.\n\nInformation on the processing of personal data of chauffeurs can be found in the [Chauffeur Privacy Policy](https://partner.blacklane.com/s/en/chauffeur-privacy-policy/) (e.g. in the BL Chauffeur App).\n\n## \u003ca id=\"NameandContactInformationoftheController\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e2. Name and Contact Information of the Controller\n\nThe controller for the processing of data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is:\n\n__Blacklane GmbH__\nFeurigstrasse 59\n10827 Berlin\nGermany\nE-Mail: \u003cinfo@blacklane.com\u003e\n\nYou can find further information on Blacklane in the [Legal Notice](https://www.blacklane.com/en/imprint/)\n\n## \u003ca id=\"ContactInformationfortheDataProtectionOfficer\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e3. Contact Information for the Data Protection Officer\n\nOur data protection officer is:\n\nBernhard Kloos, HK2 Comtection GmbH, Hausvogteiplatz 11 A, 10117 Berlin\n\nYou can contact our data protection officer confidentially by mail to the above-mentioned address. Alternatively, you can contact our data protection officer and our data protection crew by e-mail to: \u003cdataprotection@blacklane.com\u003e.\n\n## \u003ca id=\"DataSecurity\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e4. Data Security\n\nBlacklane uses appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure a level of protection for personal data appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood  and the degree of risk. The transfer of personal data between your end device and Blacklane is generally carried out in an encrypted form (TLS encryption). You can identify an encrypted connection for example by the lock symbol in the address line of your browser.  \n\nIf you communicate with us by e-mail, access by third parties cannot be ruled out. Blacklane also uses transport encryption for e-mails in general. But in the case of confidential information, Blacklane recommends using the postal way or fully encrypted e-mail communication (PGP). Please let us know if you would like to correspond with us by e-mail in an encrypted form so that we can give you information on the relevant addresses and public keys. \n\n## \u003ca id=\"Provisionofthewebsites\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e5. Provision of the websites\n\nWhen visiting Blacklane websites for information purposes, i.e. even without your registration, data is automatically collected regarding the usage through your browser (hereinafter “surf data”). This includes your IP address, the status code, the Blacklane websites visited, date and time of the server request, browser type and browser version, referrer (website visited beforehand), files transferred and data volume. The surf data is stored by Blacklane in so-called log files. If you visit Blacklane websites without having a Blacklane account, we will not know who you are.\n\nWe inform you about the cookies and analysis services used by Blacklane in section 6. Otherwise, your surf data will not be provided to third parties. \nThe processing of surf data is mainly carried out to establish and maintain the technical connection when surfing the internet. This data is also used by Blacklane in a pseudonymized or anonymized form in order to analyze the use of our websites, to design and improve the Blacklane services to meet demand, to recognize and eliminate technical or process-related disruptions and problems and to prevent illegal use of the Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks).  \n\nStored log files are erased or anonymized, provided they are no longer required to ensure the general functionality of Blacklane services. Blacklane retains the log files only insofar as you have consented to this or if there are legal retention obligations. \n\nThe legal basis for the processing of personal data when providing websites is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest). Insofar you are a Blacklane user or customer, the legal basis is also Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO (contract performance, see otherwise below [number 9](https://www.blacklane.com/en/privacy-policy/#DataProcessingDuringRegisteredUseofBlacklaneServicesandBookingRides).). If you have consented to an extended usage of your surf data, the legal basis is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (your consent). You can revoke your consent at any time.\n\n## \u003ca id=\"Cookiespixelsandsimilartechnologies\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e6. Cookies, pixels and similar technologies\n\nWhen using Blacklane services, cookies, pixels or similar methods may be used. This is common for most large websites.\n\nCookies are small text files and pixels are small graphic files which can be stored on the user's end device. You will find comprehensive information on the cookies, pixels and similar methods used by Blacklane in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.blacklane.com/en/privacy-policy/#BlacklaneCookiePolicy).\n\nAs part of your use of Blacklane Services, Blacklane sets the cookies that are necessary for Blacklane to provide a feature you request (e.g., language, login status, cookie consent). Blacklane also uses, where you have consented, its own and third party cookies to analyze and improve the use of the Blacklane Services, to improve and personalize functionality to you, to detect and correct malfunctions and problems of a technical or process nature, to prevent unlawful use of the Blacklane Services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyber-attacks) and for marketing purposes. (including the measurement, analysis and evaluation of advertising). The details of this can be found in our Cookie Policy. Your consent to the setting and use of cookies by Blacklane is documented electronically via a Consent Management Tool or Consent Management Platform (CMP) used by Blacklane. You can revoke your consent at any time with future effect or change your cookie settings; the easiest way to do this is to change your cookie settings as you wish in the CMP used by Blacklane. \n\nAdditionally, you can prevent the storage of cookies and delete existing cookies at any time in the settings of your browser. However, this may lead to the fact that individual functions of the Blacklane Services are not or only partially available. The storage period varies per cookie and can be viewed in your browser in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.blacklane.com/en/privacy-policy/#BlacklaneCookiePolicy).\n\nThe legal basis for the processing of personal data when using cookies, pixels and similar procedures are Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a (your consent) and lit. f DSGVO (legitimate interest of Blacklane in case of necessary cookies in connection with § 25 TTDSG).\n\n## \u003ca id=\"SpecialFeaturesfortheBlacklaneApps\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e7. Special Features for the Blacklane Apps\n\nBlacklane’s apps are another access point to Blacklane services. Similar processing of personal data is generally carried out via the Blacklane apps as via the Blacklane websites (see [number 5](https://www.blacklane.com/en/privacy-policy/#Provisionofthewebsites) above) or in the case of registered use of the Blacklane Services (see [number 9](https://www.blacklane.com/en/privacy-policy/#DataProcessingDuringRegisteredUseofBlacklaneServicesandBookingRides)).\n\nWhen using the Blacklane apps, Blacklane may also access additional data in relation to the app or to your end device, such as e.g. the device name, device manufacturer, model, operating system, app or SDK version, mode.\n\nThere are also push notifications in the Blacklane apps, i.e. notifications provided by Blacklane in the app of your end device. You will only receive push notifications if you have given your consent to this on your end device. The legal basis for the data processing is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (your consent).   \n\nThere is a special Blacklane App (\"BL Chauffeur\") for drivers or driving service providers working with Blacklane. You can find information on the processing of personal data carried out by means of BL Chauffeur in the [Chauffeur Privacy Policy](https://partner.blacklane.com/s/en/chauffeur-privacy-policy/).","title":"Privacy policy part 1"},{"actions":[],"sectionName":"StaticPageContent","text":"## \u003ca id=\"SocialMediaSocialNetworks\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e8. Social Media / Social Networks\n\n### 8.1 Blacklane’s Social Media Presence\n\nBlacklane maintains pages in social networks such as Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook. The respective provider of the social network provides detailed information about which personal data is processed and how. In addition, please see our notes on our pages on the respective platforms. \n\n### 8.2 Facebook, Facebook Messenger and Facebook Connect\n\nBlacklane uses services of the social network, Facebook operated by Meta Platforms Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (\"Facebook\"). The controller for the data processing in Europe for Facebook is Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. You can access Facebook’s data protection information here: [https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/)\n\nYou can contact us and exchange messages with Blacklane via __Facebook Messenger__.\n\nBlacklane also provides the option of logging in to the Blacklane account using __Facebook Connect__. In order to do this, you will be sent to a Facebook page where you may log in using your Facebook user information. If you log in to the Blacklane account using Facebook Connect, certain personal data will be transferred by Facebook to Blacklane. Facebook will inform you regarding what data will be transferred, for the purpose of which you may grant or refuse explicit consent. Personal data will not be transferred by Facebook to Blacklane without this consent. Facebook can also determine from your login via Facebook Connect that you have logged in with us and when you have done so. Blacklane uses the data transmitted by Facebook in order to identify you. \n\n__If you actively choose to log in via Facebook, you consent to Blacklane processing, in a personalized form, the data transmitted by Facebook to identify you in connection with your account. This consent may be revoked at any time without any additional costs and with effect for the future. __\n\nYou also have the option at any time to adjust the usage of Facebook Connect and log in to your Blacklane account in another manner. \n\nBlacklane uses, where you have consented to this, __Facebook Custom Audiences__ from lists to show you targeted advertising via Facebook. Blacklane creates lists of existing contacts and uploads them to Facebook via Blacklane's Facebook account. Before uploading, the list is hashed locally in the browser and only then sent to Facebook. There it is compared with Facebook's existing list of hashed IDs of Facebook users. The matches are then added to Blacklane's Custom Audience. Facebook does not collect any new personal data. \n\nThe legal basis for the processing of personal data when using Facebook Connect is in each case Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (your consent).\n\nWe will inform you in our [Cookie Policy](#BlacklaneCookiePolicy) about Facebook’s cookies, pixels and similar technologies which are used by Blacklane.\n\n### 8.3 Google Customer Match\n\nBlacklane uses the Customer Match service of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\"Google\").\n\nAt Google Customer Match, Blacklane creates lists of existing contacts and uploads them to Google via Blacklane's Google Account. Before uploading, the list is hashed locally in the browser with the SHA256 algorithm and only then transmitted to Google with TLS encryption. There it is compared with existing Google Accounts. The matches are then added to the Blacklane Audience. On this basis we can display targeted advertising via Google Ads.\n\nThe legal basis for processing personal data when using Google Customer Match is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (your consent).\n\nWe will inform you about cookies and similar procedures of Google, which are used by Blacklane, in our [Cookie Policy](#BlacklaneCookiePolicy).\n\n## \u003ca id=\"DataProcessingDuringRegisteredUseofBlacklaneServicesandBookingRides\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e9. Data Processing During Registered Use of Blacklane Services and Booking Rides\n\nBlacklane processes the following personal data provided by you when you register and use Blacklane Services or when you book rides (hereinafter “customer data”).\n\n-\tPersonal master data (form of address, title, first name, last name, company, address, zip code, place, country, password); \n-\tContact data (e.g. telephone number, cellphone number, e-mail address);\n-\tContract data (e.g. time and manner of registration, status)\n-\tRide-related data (e.g. pickup location, destination, times, flight number, special requests).\n-\tStatus (e.g. bonus program), customer history (e.g. previous rides); \n-\tContract invoicing (e.g. invoices, status, invoicing address) and payment data (e.g. last 4 digits of the credit card number).\n\nThe customer data will be used for Blacklane services, i.e. for the personalized fulfillment of the framework agreement after registration (creation, storage, administration and support of your Blacklane account), for the procurement of booked rides and for the fulfillment of the contract of carriage for the benefit of the customer with the limousine service provider. Blacklane provides customer data to third parties, if necessary, in particular to the limousine service providers so that the customer can be transported in accordance with their booking and the transport can be processed. If the customer has indicated a bonus program supported by Blacklane, the data required in this regard is transmitted to the bonus program provider. The payment data collected is stored via a payment service provider and transferred to the intermediary financial service provider or bank (see [Point 10](#PaymentandFraudPrevention)). \n\nPersonal data can be transmitted to limousine service providers in a third-party country outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area in which the transport is intended to take place. Blacklane cannot generally provide further information on the data protection level in the third-party country. An adequacy decision (see Art. 45 Paragraph 3 GDPR) or suitable guarantees (see Art. 46 GDPR) are not required for the transmission since the transmission is required for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or to carry out pre-contractual measures upon request from the data subject (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR) or because the transmission is required to enter into or to perform a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject by the controller with another natural or legal person (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit c GDPR). \n\nCustomers have the possibility to rate a ride arranged by Blacklane e.g. in the Blacklane App. Ratings are stored in the customer's profile and can be communicated to the respective driving service or provider or chauffeur in anonymised form. The customer can view his own reviews, other customers will not see these reviews. The purpose of the data processing within the evaluation system is the handling of the trip or the payment towards the driver or the dispatcher as well as the analysis and improvement of the Blacklane Services, e.g. to monitor the proper execution of trips, to increase the quality and to prevent or combat illegal use. Ratings are usually not stored for more than 2 years and then deleted or anonymised.    \n\nThe legal basis for the processing of personal data during the registered use of Blacklane Services and during the booking of trips is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (contract performance). If the data subject provides additional, voluntary information (e.g. flight number, frequent flyer programme, special requests, rating), the legal basis is their consent according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR and our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR.   \n\nIn addition, Blacklane processes customer data in order to analyse the use of the Blacklane Services, to design and improve them in a demand-oriented and personalised manner, to advertise the Blacklane Services, to detect, limit and eliminate malfunctions and problems of a technical or process-related nature and to prevent illegal use of the Blacklane Services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). In this respect, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane). Data will not be passed on to recipients in this respect unless to Blacklane's data processors (see Art. 28 GDPR) or as far as otherwise permitted by law. \n\n## \u003ca id=\"PaymentandFraudPrevention\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e10. Payment \u0026 Fraud Prevention\n\n### 10.1 Payment\n\nAll Blacklane bookings can be paid by credit or debit card. The credit card information only has to be stored once upon the first booking and is protected against unauthorized access. For this purpose, a certified payment provider is used whose systems meet the applicable security standards, such as the PCI DSS standard (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). For recurring transactions, the card data is stored with our assigned PCI DSS-certified payment provider. In this respect, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of contract). \n\nBlacklane itself does not store credit card data or only in abbreviated form for analysis purposes or to prevent fraud. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest).\n\nCard payments are provided by the payment service provider Braintree. The privacy policy for the use of the Braintree service can be found at: [https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal](https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal).\n\nInformation on new security and verification procedures in connection with the so-called Payment Services Directive (\"PSD2\") can be found at our payment service provider Braintree ([https://www.braintreepayments.com/de/legal](https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal)).\n\nIn addition to card payment, you can pay for your bookings via PayPal in our mobile apps (Android / iOS). In this case, on the basis of Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR, personal data such as the e-mail address of your PayPal account and information about your mobile device (e.g. Device ID) will be transmitted by us to PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg, for the purpose of fulfilling the contract. For more information on data processing by PayPal, please visit: [https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full](https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) \n\n### 10.2 Fraud Prevention\n\nTo ensure that a payment instrument is used by its rightful owner and to prevent fraud, IP addresses, e-mail addresses, payment data and card information may be transmitted to one or more external fraud prevention service providers. This transmission may also contain additional personal data. The external fraud prevention service providers process these personal data on behalf of Blacklane. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane).\n\nBlacklane currently uses the service provider Ravelin (Ravelin Technology Ltd., 5th Floor, 174 - 180 Old Street, London, England, EC1V 9BP) for fraud prevention purposes. For more information about Ravelin's privacy practices, please visit [https://www.ravelin.com/privacy-policy](https://www.ravelin.com/privacy-policy).\n\nIn the course of the authentication of the cardholder, it may also be necessary for individual transactions that Blacklane requires a copy of an additional identification document (e.g. identity card, passport, drivers’ licence) or a copy of the credit card. Blacklane will ask you to black out any data that is not required (e.g. the credit card number except the last four digits). In this respect, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (fulfilment of contract), your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) and our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).\n\n## \u003ca id=\"CommunicationwithBlacklane\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e11. Communication with Blacklane\n\nIf you contact Blacklane (e.g. by phone, contact form, feedback form, chat, messenger, e-mail or social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)), the data you provide will be processed to handle your request and to answer your inquiry. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) and Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR (fulfilment of contract and initiation of contract).\n\nContact data is also used by Blacklane - pseudonymised or anonymised if possible - to design and improve Blacklane services according to your needs, to identify and eliminate malfunctions and problems of a technical or process-related nature and to prevent illegal use of Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). In this respect, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane).\n\nBlacklane also uses external services and tools, e.g. messenger services or chat support tools, to communicate with the customer. The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane). Agreements on commissioned data processing exist with the respective providers - where necessary.\n\nIn this context, we use Intercom as a communication medium, either by e-mail or by messages within our products. The Intercom Messenger apps and apps in inbox products can also give you access to other third-party applications such as Stripe. You should consult the privacy notices of these third parties for more information about how they use your personal information. As part of our service agreements, Intercom collects publicly available contact and social information about you, such as your email address, gender, company, job title, photos, website URLs, social networking sites and physical addresses, to improve your user experience. For more information about Intercom's privacy practices, please visit [https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy](https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy).\n\nBlacklane also offers customers different feedback channels, also via external platforms. Such customer feedback is also used to process your request and also - if possible pseudonymized or anonymized - to design and improve Blacklane Services according to your needs, to recognize and eliminate malfunctions and problems of a technical or process-related nature and to prevent illegal use of Blacklane Services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). The legal basis for the data processing is, if you have separately and explicitly agreed, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) and otherwise Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane). With the respective providers of feedback tools there are again - as far as necessary - agreements on commissioned data processing. The respective feedback tool may contain additional information about which data is collected and in which way data is processed.\n\n## \u003ca id=\"EmailAdvertisingNewsletter\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e12. E-mail Advertising, Newsletter\n\nIf you have agreed to receiving advertising or if Blacklane otherwise has the right, we will use your customer data to send you personalized advertising or general newsletters. The following data is mainly affected: Form of address, name, e-mail address. The purpose of the data processing is for Blacklane to inform you regarding current offers and to draw attention to features of Blacklane services.  \n\nE-mail advertising and newsletters may contain pixels. In this case, a graphic file is inserted into the e-mail sent in HTML format, based on which a statistical evaluation may be carried out. By using pixels, Blacklane can detect whether and when e-mails have been opened and links contained therein clicked. \nThe legal base for the data processing is, insofar as you have separately and expressly consented, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (consent) and otherwise Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest) in conjunction with Section 7 Paragraph 3 of the German Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG). \n\nBlacklane has the right, in context of legal permission according to Section 7 Paragraph 3 UWG, to use the e-mail address, which you have provided regarding a chargeable booking, to directly advertise its own, similar products or services. If you do not wish to receive advertising from Blacklane for similar products or services, you may at any time revoke the corresponding use of your e-mail address without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs in accordance with the base tariffs. To this end, you can use the unsubscribe link contained in any mail or you can write an e-mail to us using the above-mentioned e-mail addresses (see [section 2](https://www.blacklane.com/en/privacy-policy/#NameandContactInformationoftheController)).\n\n## \u003ca id=\"InvolvementofDataProcessorsbyBlacklane\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e13. Involvement of Data Processors by Blacklane\n\nAs far as Blacklane involves third parties in its data processing, e.g. technical service providers or other Blacklane subsidiaries, this is always done on behalf of Blacklane and only if these processors offer sufficient guarantees that suitable technical and organisational measures are carried out in such a way that the processing is in accordance with the data protection requirements, in particular Art. 28 GDPR, and guarantees the protection of the rights of the data subject. If processors are located in third countries, the data protection requirements for the transfer pursuant to Art. 44 et seq. GDPR are complied with in each case. As a rule, the appropriate guarantees in third countries are established by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 para. 3 GDPR) or the agreement of standard contractual clauses (see Art. 46 para. 2 c) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 93 para. 2 GDPR). \n\n## \u003ca id=\"RightsofDataSubjects\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e14 Rights of Data Subjects\n\nIf your personal data is processed by Blacklane, you are the data subject (Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR). As the data subject, you have the following rights in relation to the personal data affecting you:\n\n### 14.1 Right to information (Art. 15 GDPR)\n\nThe data subject has the right to obtain a confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data is processed; if this is the case, they have a right of information about this personal data and further information on the data processing.\n\n### 14.2 Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)\n\nThe data subject has the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification or completion of inaccurate personal data.\n\n### 14.3 Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)\n\nThe data subject has the right to demand from the controller the erasure of personal data without undue delay and the controller is obliged to erase personal data without undue delay, provided the data is no longer required, the data subject revokes their consent or lodges an objection to the processing, the personal data was processed unlawfully or there is otherwise a ground for erasure within the meaning of Art. 17 GDPR and the controller does not have the right to object to erasure.\n\n### 14.4 Right to the restriction of data processing (Art. 18 GDPR)\n\nThe data subject has the right to demand from the controller the restriction of processing when one of the conditions mentioned in Art. 18 GDPR applies, namely the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject or the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data.\n\n### 14.5 Right to objection (Art. 21 GDPR)\n\nInsofar as the data processing is based on a legitimate interest from our side (Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR) or is direct advertising, the data subject has at any time the right to lodge an objection to the processing of personal data affecting them for the reasons mentioned in Art. 21 GDPR. The controller will then no longer process the personal data, unless they can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or the processing serves for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\n\n### 14.6 Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)\n\nThe data subject has the right within the meaning of Art. 20 GDPR to receive the personal data, which they have provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided.\n\n### 14.7 Right to lodge a complaint (Art. 77 GDPR)\n\nWithout prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority according to Art. 77 GDPR.\n\n### 14.8 Revocation of consent (Art. 7 para. 4 GDPR)\n\nIf the data processing is based on the consent of a data subject, the data subject has the right to revoke his or her consent at any time. You can do this by sending an e-mail to: \u003cdataprotection@blacklane.com\u003e. The revocation of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation. \n\n## \u003ca id=\"Automateddecisions\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e15. Automated decisions\n\nIn the case of Blacklane, you are only subject to an automated decision process (see Art. 22 GDPR) in exceptional cases if you re-enter a payment method via which a payment has already previously failed or when current indications justify the suspicion that it is a fraudulent booking. In these cases, your request to book a ride with Blacklane will be refused. Such an automatic decision is required to conclude the contract (Art. 22 Paragraph 2 lit a GDPR). The data subject has the option of contacting us using the mentioned contact data (see [section 2](https://www.blacklane.com/en/privacy-policy/#NameandContactInformationoftheController)) in order to have an explanation or an intervention by a person or to express their point of view.\n\n## \u003ca id=\"DataErasureandStorageDuration\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e16. Data Erasure and Storage Duration\n\nWe will erase your personal data as soon as the legal basis for its processing lapses. However, legal bases may also exist in parallel or a new one may intervene with the lapsing of a legal basis, such as for example the duty to store determined data to fulfill a legal retention obligation (e.g. according to commercial or tax law).\n\n## \u003ca id=\"AmendmentorUpdateofthisPrivacyPolicy\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e17. Amendment or Update of this Privacy Policy\n\nBlacklane reserves the right to update or amend this privacy policy at any time without giving reasons, as far as this should become necessary, e. g. due to developments in legislation, jurisdiction or regulatory actions or due to further technical developments.\n\nIssued: March 23, 2022.\n\n# \u003ca id=\"BlacklaneCookiePolicy\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eBlacklane Cookie Policy\n\nBlacklane uses cookies, pixels or similar technologies (e.g. by means of tags, web beacons or gifs). These are small files which are stored on your end device so that we can recognize you or collect information better when you use Blacklane websites or a Blacklane app. \n\nCookies may be distinguished according to their operating life between session cookies, which are deleted automatically after ending the browser session or permanent cookies, which are stored beyond the individual browser session and enable subsequent recognition of the end device. A distinction is also made between Blacklane’s own cookies and those of third parties.\n\nYou may prevent the storage of cookies at any time using your browser settings or delete any cookies present. However, this may mean that some functions of Blacklane services may not be available or available only to a limited extent. The storage duration is different depending on the cookie and can be inspected in your browser. \n\nThe legal basis for the processing of personal data when using cookies, pixels and similar technologies is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a (consent) and lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest).  \n\nIn the context of your visit, Blacklane will set the required cookies, which are technically necessary, to improve functionality or make the use of Blacklane services more user-friendly. This concerns, for example,\n\n- Your identification and authentication, \n-\tStorage and user preferences and settings (e.g. language settings), which you have made, \n-\tthe inclusion of information already provided so that repeated input of information is not necessary,\n-\tsecurity-related cookies or \n-\tcookies for using multimedia players \n\nBlacklane also uses its own cookies in order to analyze and improve the usage of Blacklane services, to detect and remedy interruptions and problems of a technical or process-related nature and to prevent illegal usage of Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). Evaluations by Blacklane take place in pseudonymized or anonymized form as far as is possible.\n\nAdditionally, Blacklane uses its own cookies, pixels or similar technologies or those originating from advertising partners (e.g. search engine providers, advertising networks or distribution partners) in order to improve Blacklane services or to measure, evaluate, design and improve advertising measures. Blacklane uses different analysis tools in this regard. In this respect, an evaluation by Blacklane takes place in pseudonymized or anonymized form as far as is possible.\n\nThe following cookies, pixels and similar technologies may be used in the context of Blacklane’s services:\n","title":"Privacy policy part 2"},{"actions":[],"sectionName":"StaticPageContent","text":"### \u003ca id=\"Adjust\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAdjust\n\nBlacklane uses the provider Adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37A, 10405 Berlin, Germany (“Adjust”). \n\nAdjust provides mobile analytics and attribution services for app providers.

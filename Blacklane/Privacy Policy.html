Data Processing During Registered Use of Blacklane Services and Booking Rides</h2>
<p>Blacklane processes the following personal data provided by you when you register and use Blacklane Services or when you book rides (hereinafter “customer data”).</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal master data (form of address, title, first name, last name, company, address, zip code, place, country, password);</li>
<li>Contact data (e.g. telephone number, cellphone number, e-mail address);</li>
<li>Contract data (e.g. time and manner of registration, status)</li>
<li>Ride-related data (e.g. pickup location, destination, times, flight number, special requests).</li>
<li>Status (e.g. bonus program), customer history (e.g. previous rides);</li>
<li>Contract invoicing (e.g. invoices, status, invoicing address) and payment data (e.g. last 4 digits of the credit card number).</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer data will be used for Blacklane services, i.e. for the personalized fulfillment of the framework agreement after registration (creation, storage, administration and support of your Blacklane account), for the procurement of booked rides and for the fulfillment of the contract of carriage for the benefit of the customer with the limousine service provider. Blacklane provides customer data to third parties, if necessary, in particular to the limousine service providers so that the customer can be transported in accordance with their booking and the transport can be processed. If the customer has indicated a bonus program supported by Blacklane, the data required in this regard is transmitted to the bonus program provider. The payment data collected is stored via a payment service provider and transferred to the intermediary financial service provider or bank (see <a href="#PaymentandFraudPrevention">Point 10</a>).</p>
<p>Personal data can be transmitted to limousine service providers in a third-party country outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area in which the transport is intended to take place. Blacklane cannot generally provide further information on the data protection level in the third-party country. An adequacy decision (see Art. 45 Paragraph 3 GDPR) or suitable guarantees (see Art. 46 GDPR) are not required for the transmission since the transmission is required for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or to carry out pre-contractual measures upon request from the data subject (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR) or because the transmission is required to enter into or to perform a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject by the controller with another natural or legal person (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit c GDPR).</p>
<p>Customers have the possibility to rate a ride arranged by Blacklane e.g. in the Blacklane App. Ratings are stored in the customer's profile and can be communicated to the respective driving service or provider or chauffeur in anonymised form. The customer can view his own reviews, other customers will not see these reviews. The purpose of the data processing within the evaluation system is the handling of the trip or the payment towards the driver or the dispatcher as well as the analysis and improvement of the Blacklane Services, e.g. to monitor the proper execution of trips, to increase the quality and to prevent or combat illegal use. Ratings are usually not stored for more than 2 years and then deleted or anonymised.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data during the registered use of Blacklane Services and during the booking of trips is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (contract performance). If the data subject provides additional, voluntary information (e.g. flight number, frequent flyer programme, special requests, rating), the legal basis is their consent according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR and our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>
<p>In addition, Blacklane processes customer data in order to analyse the use of the Blacklane Services, to design and improve them in a demand-oriented and personalised manner, to advertise the Blacklane Services, to detect, limit and eliminate malfunctions and problems of a technical or process-related nature and to prevent illegal use of the Blacklane Services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). In this respect, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane). Data will not be passed on to recipients in this respect unless to Blacklane's data processors (see Art. 28 GDPR) or as far as otherwise permitted by law.</p>

<h3><a id="10.1-payment" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#10.1-payment"></a>10.1 Payment</h3>
<p>All Blacklane bookings can be paid by credit or debit card. The credit card information only has to be stored once upon the first booking and is protected against unauthorized access. For this purpose, a certified payment provider is used whose systems meet the applicable security standards, such as the PCI DSS standard (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). For recurring transactions, the card data is stored with our assigned PCI DSS-certified payment provider. In this respect, the legal basis for the processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of contract).</p>
<p>Blacklane itself does not store credit card data or only in abbreviated form for analysis purposes or to prevent fraud. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest).</p>
<p>Card payments are provided by the payment service provider Braintree. The privacy policy for the use of the Braintree service can be found at: <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal"><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal">https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal</a></a>.</p>
<p>Information on new security and verification procedures in connection with the so-called Payment Services Directive (&quot;PSD2&quot;) can be found at our payment service provider Braintree (<a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal"><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/de/legal">https://www.braintreepayments.com/de/legal</a></a>).</p>
<p>In addition to card payment, you can pay for your bookings via PayPal in our mobile apps (Android / iOS). In this case, on the basis of Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR, personal data such as the e-mail address of your PayPal account and information about your mobile device (e.g. Device ID) will be transmitted by us to PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg, for the purpose of fulfilling the contract. For more information on data processing by PayPal, please visit: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full"><a href="https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full</a></a></p>
<h3><a id="10.2-fraud-prevention" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#10.2-fraud-prevention"></a>10.2 Fraud Prevention</h3>
<p>To ensure that a payment instrument is used by its rightful owner and to prevent fraud, IP addresses, e-mail addresses, payment data and card information may be transmitted to one or more external fraud prevention service providers. This transmission may also contain additional personal data. The external fraud prevention service providers process these personal data on behalf of Blacklane. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane).</p>
<p>Blacklane currently uses the service provider Ravelin (Ravelin Technology Ltd., 5th Floor, 174 - 180 Old Street, London, England, EC1V 9BP) for fraud prevention purposes. For more information about Ravelin's privacy practices, please visit <a href="https://www.ravelin.com/privacy-policy"><a href="https://www.ravelin.com/privacy-policy">https://www.ravelin.com/privacy-policy</a></a>.</p>
<p>In the course of the authentication of the cardholder, it may also be necessary for individual transactions that Blacklane requires a copy of an additional identification document (e.g. identity card, passport, drivers’ licence) or a copy of the credit card. Blacklane will ask you to black out any data that is not required (e.g. the credit card number except the last four digits). In this respect, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (fulfilment of contract), your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) and our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).</p>
<h2><a id="a-id-communicationwithblacklane" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-id-communicationwithblacklane"></a><a id="CommunicationwithBlacklane"></a>11. Communication with Blacklane</h2>
<p>If you contact Blacklane (e.g. by phone, contact form, feedback form, chat, messenger, e-mail or social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)), the data you provide will be processed to handle your request and to answer your inquiry. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) and Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR (fulfilment of contract and initiation of contract).</p>
<p>Contact data is also used by Blacklane - pseudonymised or anonymised if possible - to design and improve Blacklane services according to your needs, to identify and eliminate malfunctions and problems of a technical or process-related nature and to prevent illegal use of Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). In this respect, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane).</p>
<p>Blacklane also uses external services and tools, e.g. messenger services or chat support tools, to communicate with the customer. The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane). Agreements on commissioned data processing exist with the respective providers - where necessary.</p>
<p>In this context, we use Intercom as a communication medium, either by e-mail or by messages within our products. The Intercom Messenger apps and apps in inbox products can also give you access to other third-party applications such as Stripe. You should consult the privacy notices of these third parties for more information about how they use your personal information. As part of our service agreements, Intercom collects publicly available contact and social information about you, such as your email address, gender, company, job title, photos, website URLs, social networking sites and physical addresses, to improve your user experience. For more information about Intercom's privacy practices, please visit <a href="https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy"><a href="https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy">https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy</a></a>.</p>
<p>Blacklane also offers customers different feedback channels, also via external platforms. Such customer feedback is also used to process your request and also - if possible pseudonymized or anonymized - to design and improve Blacklane Services according to your needs, to recognize and eliminate malfunctions and problems of a technical or process-related nature and to prevent illegal use of Blacklane Services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). The legal basis for the data processing is, if you have separately and explicitly agreed, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent) and otherwise Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane). With the respective providers of feedback tools there are again - as far as necessary - agreements on commissioned data processing. The respective feedback tool may contain additional information about which data is collected and in which way data is processed.</p>
<h2><a id="a-id-emailadvertisingnewsletter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-id-emailadvertisingnewsletter"></a><a id="EmailAdvertisingNewsletter"></a>12. E-mail Advertising, Newsletter</h2>
<p>If you have agreed to receiving advertising or if Blacklane otherwise has the right, we will use your customer data to send you personalized advertising or general newsletters. The following data is mainly affected: Form of address, name, e-mail address. The purpose of the data processing is for Blacklane to inform you regarding current offers and to draw attention to features of Blacklane services.</p>
<p>E-mail advertising and newsletters may contain pixels. In this case, a graphic file is inserted into the e-mail sent in HTML format, based on which a statistical evaluation may be carried out. By using pixels, Blacklane can detect whether and when e-mails have been opened and links contained therein clicked.
The legal base for the data processing is, insofar as you have separately and expressly consented, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (consent) and otherwise Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest) in conjunction with Section 7 Paragraph 3 of the German Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG).</p>
<p>Blacklane has the right, in context of legal permission according to Section 7 Paragraph 3 UWG, to use the e-mail address, which you have provided regarding a chargeable booking, to directly advertise its own, similar products or services. If you do not wish to receive advertising from Blacklane for similar products or services, you may at any time revoke the corresponding use of your e-mail address without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs in accordance with the base tariffs. To this end, you can use the unsubscribe link contained in any mail or you can write an e-mail to us using the above-mentioned e-mail addresses (see <a href="https://www.blacklane.com/en/privacy-policy/#NameandContactInformationoftheController">section 2</a>).</p>

<p>As far as Blacklane involves third parties in its data processing, e.g. technical service providers or other Blacklane subsidiaries, this is always done on behalf of Blacklane and only if these processors offer sufficient guarantees that suitable technical and organisational measures are carried out in such a way that the processing is in accordance with the data protection requirements, in particular Art. 28 GDPR, and guarantees the protection of the rights of the data subject. If processors are located in third countries, the data protection requirements for the transfer pursuant to Art. 44 et seq. GDPR are complied with in each case. As a rule, the appropriate guarantees in third countries are established by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 para. 3 GDPR) or the agreement of standard contractual clauses (see Art. 46 para. 2 c) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 93 para. 2 GDPR).</p>

<p>DoubleClick by Google uses cookies to present to you adverts that are relevant for you. If you visit our website, a pseudonymous identification number (ID) is assigned to your browser in the form of cookies to verify which adverts were displayed in your browser and which adverts were accessed. The cookies do not contain personal information.

<h3><a id="a-id-googleads" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-id-googleads"></a><a id="GoogleAds"></a>Google Ads (former Google AdWords Conversion Tracker)</h3>
<p>Blacklane uses the online advertising program “Google AdWords” and as part of Google AdWords, the conversion tracking of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”).</p>
<p>We use the Google AdWords service to bring attention to our services with the help of adverts (so-called Google AdWords) on external websites. The cookie for conversion tracking is placed when a user clicks on an AdWords advert placed by Google. Cookies are small text files which are stored on your computer system. These cookies generally become invalid after 30 days and do not allow personal identification. If you visited a certain site and if the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can recognize that you have clicked on the advert and were taken to this site. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The collected information by use of the conversion cookie serves to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. The customers find out the total number of users who have clicked on their advert and were taken to a page provided with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information by means of which users can be personally identified. The data collected will be stored and processed in the USA.</p>
<p>If you would not like to participate in tracking, you may block its usage by deactivating the Google conversion tracking cookie in your internet browser under user settings. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>

Blacklane provides customer data to third parties, if necessary, in particular to the limousine service providers so that the customer can be transported in accordance with their booking and the transport can be processed. If the customer has indicated a bonus program supported by Blacklane, the data required in this regard is transmitted to the bonus program provider. The payment data collected is stored via a payment service provider and transferred to the intermediary financial service provider or bank (see \u003ca href=\"#PaymentandFraudPrevention\"\u003ePoint 10\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal data can be transmitted to limousine service providers in a third-party country outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area in which the transport is intended to take place. Blacklane cannot generally provide further information on the data protection level in the third-party country. An adequacy decision (see Art. 45 Paragraph 3 GDPR) or suitable guarantees (see Art. 46 GDPR) are not required for the transmission since the transmission is required for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or to carry out pre-contractual measures upon request from the data subject (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR) or because the transmission is required to enter into or to perform a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject by the controller with another natural or legal person (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit c GDPR).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCustomers have the possibility to rate a ride arranged by Blacklane e.g. in the Blacklane App. Ratings are stored in the customer's profile and can be communicated to the respective driving service or provider or chauffeur in anonymised form. The customer can view his own reviews, other customers will not see these reviews. The purpose of the data processing within the evaluation system is the handling of the trip or the payment towards the driver or the dispatcher as well as the analysis and improvement of the Blacklane Services, e.g. to monitor the proper execution of trips, to increase the quality and to prevent or combat illegal use. Ratings are usually not stored for more than 2 years and then deleted or anonymised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe legal basis for the processing of personal data during the registered use of Blacklane Services and during the booking of trips is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (contract performance).

The Marketer platform will display the Marketer Tools that are available to you, and the applicable fees.  Marketer Tools that may be available include: <br/><br/></p><ul><li><strong>Offers</strong>: offering discounts to customers ordering from your Sites via the Platform; and </li><li><strong>Adverts</strong>: placement of your Site within our ‘Featured Carousel’ on the Platform. </li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Marketer Platform access: </strong>The Marketer Platform is accessed through Restaurant Hub. Deliveroo has taken steps to limit access to the Marketer platform from Restaurant Hub to users listed as a ‘Manager’ or “Admin” within Restaurant Hub. It is your responsibility to ensure that only appropriate users hold ‘Manager’ or “Admin” status and that you and all users keep login credentials safe. </p><p></p><p><strong>Marketer Tool period: </strong>Subject to availability, the Marketer Tool you have selected will be live from the start date and time to the earlier of: (i) the end date and time you select; and (ii) the date on which you notify us of your wish to cancel your advert; and (iii) when your total budget is used up, in each case depending on the options selected by you in the Marketing Tool in relation to the renewal of your budget, and furthermore in each case unless terminated or suspended earlier in line with these Terms. Start and end dates and times refer to the timezone in which the Site is located.<strong> </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Which Customers will your Marketer Tools be made available to:  </strong>When creating a Marketer Tool, you may be able to select Customer eligibility criteria from a range of options. Deliveroo will try to ensure your Marketer Tool is only available to your selected audience, however we can’t guarantee that Customers that don’t meet the criteria will not be included and will not be responsible to you for any cost or loss you incur if ineligible Customers participate.   </p><p></p><p><strong>Changes or cancellations:  </strong>You may cancel a Marketer Tool at any time without penalty. To change the terms of a live Marketer Tool, you must cancel it and set up a new Marketer Tool with revised terms.  <br/><br/></p><p><strong>Use of Marketer Tools:  </strong>You must act in good faith, follow good industry practice and comply with Deliveroo’s policies from time to time when using the Marketer Tools.  You must not do or omit to do anything when using the Marketer Tools that is likely to lead to harm to Deliveroo’s business, reputation, partners or Customers. Your use of any Marketer Tools must be compliant with all applicable laws in force from time to time in the locations in which your Marketer Tool is used. Any abusive or misleading use of the Marketer Tools, for example increasing your prices prior to an Offer, may result in your suspension from the Marketer platform and/or the Deliveroo Platform. </p><p></p><p><strong>Charges and invoicing:  </strong>You are responsible for: (i) the cost of any offers or promotions you offer to Customers using a Marketer Tool; and (ii) applicable fees for the Marketer Tool (<strong>Marketer Charges</strong>). Unless stated otherwise on the Marketer platform, fees for Marketer Tools are stated exclusive of VAT/GST or other applicable sales tax (if any). Marketer Charges will be deducted from the amounts payable to you under your Services Agreement and will show as an adjustment on your invoice.  </p><p></p><p><strong>Availability and performance: </strong>Deliveroo makes no warranty or representation about the availability or effectiveness of any Marketer Tool. Marketer Tools are provided “as is” and “as available” and all express and implied conditions, warranties and other terms about the availability or performance of a Marketer Tool are excluded as far as permitted by law. </p><p></p><p><strong>Liability for Marketer Tools:</strong> You are responsible for all Marketer Tools created using your access rights to the Marketer platform. To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability for Marketer Tools is limited to an amount equal to the fees paid for the specific use of the Marketer Tool to which the cause of action relates.  </p><p></p><p><strong>Our rights:  </strong>Any and all intellectual property in the Marketer platform and any Marketer Tool are, and will continue to be, owned by Deliveroo. Except as granted in these Terms, we do not grant you any rights in or to such intellectual property.</p><p></p><p><strong>Termination and/or suspension of access:  </strong>If we believe that your use of a Marketer Tool is or may be in breach of applicable law or these Terms we reserve the right to: (i) suspend or terminate the Marketer Tool; (ii) restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Marketer platform and Marketer Tools; (iii) suspend you from the Platform; (iv) terminate the Services Agreement; and/or (v) take such other action as Deliveroo deems reasonable in the circumstances. </p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Marketer Tool - Special Terms</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>If you are launching an Offer: </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The Offer: </strong>You can select the value and nature of your Offer from a range of options, which may vary from time to time. <br/><br/></p><ul><li>Where an Offer reduces the total basket value (e.g. a percentage or fixed sum discount), those discounts will be applied to the subtotal of the items in the Customer’s basket (excluding delivery, service and small order fees and any tips) before any tax is applied.  <br/><br/></li><li>Where an Offer removes or reduces fees that would otherwise be payable by the Customer, this will be applied prior to the Customer completing their Order. Please note that Customer fees vary between Orders depending on a number of different factors.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>How the Offer will be funded</strong>: Unless we agree otherwise, you will cover the cost of all Offers redeemed by customers. If an Offer reduces the total basket value, your service fee will be calculated on the discounted price paid by the Customer. If we agree to fund an Offer, your service fee will be calculated on the undiscounted price.  </p><p></p><p><strong>Customer Refunds: </strong>If a Customer is eligible for a refund in respect of an Order made under an Offer, the Customer will be refunded the discounted amount they paid for the Order. Responsibility for refunds will be determined in accordance with the terms of our Services Agreement.    </p><p></p><p><strong>Reference price restrictions: </strong>You may not create an Offer discounting total Order basket value if in the 30 days before the Offer goes live, you increase the prices of Menu Items that are included in the Offer by more than 5%. For 30 days after the Offer finishes, you may not increase the price of a Menu Item that was included in that Offer by more than 5%. These restrictions apply without prejudice to any more stringent requirements under applicable law.  </p><p></p><p><strong>Other information:  </strong>Further information governing how an Offer is managed are set out in the FAQs and associated help centre articles.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>How the Advert will be funded:  </strong>You’ll pay for the number of clicks your Advert receives, with each click costing the cost-per-menu-view you select when you created your Advert. If you select to have your campaign run continually, during the first week of the campaign, the budget you decide to allocate will be pro-rated, depending on when during the calendar week you created the campaign. E.g. If you allocate a continuous budget of EUR 700 and create your campaign on Thursday, your pro-rated budget for the first week of your campaign will be EUR 400 (regardless of the hour you created your campaign), as there are 4 out of 7 days of the week remaining. For future weeks, your budget will be EUR 700.</p><p></p><p>Your Advert will end at the earlier of:</p><p>(i) when your total budget is used up; and</p><p>(ii) either:</p><p>(A) at 23:59 on your end date (if you opt for one-off budgets); or</p><p>(B) the date on which you notify us that you wish to cancel your Advert; or</p><p>(C) the date on which your access to the Marketer Tool is terminated or suspended in accordance with these Terms,(as applicable).</p><p> </p><p>In addition to the above, if you select to have your campaign run continually, then your Advert will start again on the following Monday, unless the Advert is cancelled by you or your access to the Marketer Tool is terminated or suspended in accordance with these Terms.</p><p></p></div></div><div

                        <p>The data will be collected by the Classgap encrypted form and sent to Braintree, which handles elcetronic payment transactions externally.</p>
                        <p>Braintree, will store and treat such details independently.</p>

In this regard, it should be noted that, unless stipulated differently in other manner in this document, the price of the class will not be refundable.</p>

                                CLASSGAP will obtain a percentage of 10% of the price set by the tutor when the booking comes from their own channels, through a link provided to that effect.

                                4. Tutor payment costs: bank transfer or Paypal each month.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>We reserve the right to modify at any time the service fees (or to start charging for free services) with the condition that such changes do not have retroactive character to the fees paid before the date of the change.</p>
                        <h4>I'm a tutor, how and when will I receive my earnings?</h4>
                        <p>
                            At the end of each month we will analyze how much you have earned. There are two posible scenarios:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <span>You have earned more than 50 euros:</span>
                                    We will transfer your earnings at no cost by bank transfer (for CEE bank accounts) or Paypal.
                                    <br />
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span>You have earned less than 50 euros:</span>
                                    In this case we will keep your earnings until you reach this threshold.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    According to the <a href="/my/tutor/profile?tab=6">visibility level you chose</a>, your profile will be more or less visible and other commissions will apply to the first class with each student.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>This duality in the payment method is aimed for all the parts to save costs. Thus, if the tutor lives outside Spain the field to be filled out in CLASSGAP is the one for the PayPal account.</p>
                        <p>The tutor must be autonomous (freelance) and fulfill the obligations with IRS (generally it must bill with the IVA tax). However, CLASSGAP is not responsible for controlling the fulfillment of said obligations.</p>
                        <h4>Tutoring hour packages</h4>
                        <p>Optionally, teachers may offer lower prices for class hours if the student contracts packages of hours in advance.</p>
                        <p>Packages will be a minimum of 5 hours, and must be spent in 1 hour classes. All packages are valid for 6 months and are valid only with the selected teacher. Once the pack has expired, the tutor and the student will not be able to recover the amount of these classes.</p>
                        <p>Once one or more classes of a package have been completed, no refunds will be made, except in those cases in which the teacher certifies that he or she cannot continue teaching.</p>
                        <h4>Free class 15 minutes</h4>
                        <p>Optionally tutors can offer students a 15 minute class. Students can book without any cost a 15 minute class to those tutors that have this option.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can book up to 3 free classes per student.</li>
                            <li>A maximum of 1 free book with the same tutor.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Teachers who want to offer a free 15 minute class must have Classgap APP installed on your device.</p>
                        <h4>What is my visibility level as a tutor ?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Your profile visibility in the teachers grid depends on a several factors :
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The visibility level you have selected from your personal area
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The quality of your profile, as in the number of classes you have given on Classgap, the time it takes you to reply to messages or to accept a booking and the conversion rate from free interviews to chargeable classes
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Your availabilities at that time. You will not appear the days you have marked as absent from your personal area
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Refund by complaints regarding quality of the lesson:</h4>
                        <p>When can a student ask for a full refund?</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When the class has not been done due to the abscence of the tutor.</li>
                            <li>When the class is cancelled for any reason at least 8 hours before the scheduled time of the class.</li>
                            <li>Within 24 hours after the class, when it’s your first class at Classgap and you feel unsatisfied.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            To ask for a full refund due to dissatisfaction, please send an email to support@classgap.com with your reasons and your personal information (name, surname, phone number and a copy of your ID) and we will contact you.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the student ask for a full refund, we reserve the right not to pay the class to the tutor.</p>
                        <p>CLASSGAP acts merely as an intermediary between students and teachers and is therefore not responsible for any claims that may arise in respect of cancellations or refunds made, errors in them, or the teacher's decision not to make them when the class has been made. In the event that the student requests a refund of the price paid within 7 calendar days of booking the class, provided that there are more than 48 hours left to start the class, and the class has not been completed, CLASSGAP will study the reasons for this request and, if it considers them justified, may proceed to a refund, informing the teacher of the reasons for it.</p>

                                User trust is important to us, and therefore, at Classgap we care about protecting your privacy. An important aspect of this is to provide you with as much information as possible about how we use your personal data, including how we use local data storage and similar technology.

                            <h4>What does local data storage, cookies and similar technology mean?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Local data storage involves storing different types of data locally on your device through your web browser. Locally stored data may, for example, contain user settings, information about how you browse our websites, which web browser you use, what ads have been displayed, and similar behavior on websites with which we collaborate. Locally stored data may be used to customize the content and functions in our services so that your visits are more convenient and meaningful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One method of local data storage is cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (PC, mobile phone or tablet) that allow us to recognize your web browser. Cookies contain information mainly about your web browser and any activity that has occurred on it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to local data storage, we may use other similar technology, such as web beacons/pixel tags. This technology recognizes cookies and identifiers, and allows third parties to set cookies on your device. Web beacons can be used to determine which ads should be displayed in your web browser.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this document, the term "local data storage" is used as a collective term for cookies, web beacons and other similar technology.

                            <h4>Why does Classgap use local data storage on its websites and apps?</h4>
                            <p>
                                We use local data storage for a variety of purposes, such as: enabling us to perform our services; providing you with relevant, personalized content when you visit our websites; measuring and analyzing traffic to our websites; improving our services; and targeting specific advertising. Further details on these issues are given below.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Who else uses local data storage on Classgap?</h4>
                            <p>
                                We use local data storage ourselves, and allow our suppliers to use it when providing their services to us. These providers are subject to the agreements of data processors, and are not permitted to use the data for purposes other than providing the service we have requested.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to our own use, we also offer third parties the opportunity to use data storage on your device when you visit our services. We have developed strict guidelines on how third parties may collect and use data about our visitors. The guidelines indicate that data can only be used for clearly defined purposes.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Application areas for local data storage:</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>To deliver and adapt the services to your use.</li>
                                <li>Local data storage is required and necessary in order to allow you to use our services, such as configuration information, which tells us how the services should be presented in your web browser.</li>
                                <li>We also use local data storage to tailor our services to your best use. For example, to store settings to store information about the best video quality available for your web browser and the speed of the Internet, or to allow the use of special features, such as the option to store classified ads or retain previous searches and saved listings.</li>
                                <li>To analyze and improve our services</li>
                                <li>We use a variety of measurement tools that provide us with statistics and analyses relating to our services. These tools allow us to recognize the web browser over time and find out if the user has visited the website before and if so how often. These tools give us the possibility to get an overview of how many unique users we have and how they use our services.</li>
                                <li>We also use the information we have collected and analyzed to develop and improve our cooperative services and services at Tus Media, for example, by finding out which services generate a lot of traffic or by seeing if a service is working optimally.</li>
                                <li>Our advertising</li>
                                <li>We use local data storage in connection with Classgap's advertising activities. This allows us to know if and how often the user has seen an ad or certain type of ad, and how long ago they saw it. We also use local data storage to build segments and target groups for marketing purposes and to target specific ads. You can read more about how target groups and segments are created in connection with advertising here: <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/." target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/.</a></li>
                                <li>The following link includes didactic videos in video tutorial format that explain, step by step, how to configure the privacy options of the most common browsers, social networks and mobile operating systems:</li>

                                <li>We also use local data storage on other websites in connection with Classgap advertising when the user has visited other websites on which we advertise, as well as local data storage set up by other players. This provides us with information about, for example, which website the user visited before visiting our portals and allows us to target our advertising based on this information. For example, we may display travel ads if the user recently visited an airline's website. The information we collect through local data storage does not contain directly identifiable data. We receive information about which pages you visited, but not about who the user is.</li>
                                <li>Third Party Advertising</li>
                                <li>As on other commercial websites, Classgap's services also include advertisements provided by other players. Most actors use local data storage. Local data storage is used to find cookies or anonymous identifiers on your device to find out which ads should be displayed or which ads have been displayed on your web browser. Local data storage is also used to measure the effect of ads by measuring how many users clicked on a specific ad and how many actually completed a purchase. We do not allow this data to be linked directly to the user you. Classgap has the ability to read data from third-party cookies such as these.</li>
                                <li>These companies may use local data storage to target specific advertisements on other websites based on your visit to Classgap . You can learn more about this type of advertising here: <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/helpful-videos/." target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/helpful-videos/.</a></li>

                            <h4>How can I manage locally stored data?</h4>
                            <p>You can adjust the settings in your web browser or use special programs that have been developed to manage cookies.</p>
                            <p>
                                The settings in your web browser usually display a list of all cookies that have been stored to provide you with an overview and, if you wish, to remove unwanted cookies. Normally, you can indicate that you accept the storage of cookies from the websites you visit or from third parties affiliated with those websites. You can also choose to be notified each time a new cookie is stored. Guidance on how to do this in different web browsers is provided below. Your web browser normally stores cookies in a specific folder on your hard drive, so that you can also browse the content in more detail.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Classgap has also prepared a list of the main forms of local data storage available on our website and more details on their purpose. The list is available below under'Overview of the technology we use'.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, the cookies that are present on the website change frequently, and not all cookies are equally important. Classgap will therefore regularly update the list of which cookies are available.

<p>Without prejudice to the above, the Users cede to Tus Media, on a non-exclusive basis, for the maximum time permitted by the intellectual property law, and with a worldwide territorial scope, the exploitation rights that fall on the Contents and/or materials incorporated, and in particular the rights of reproduction, public communication, and making them available to the public via Internet, transformation, especially to translate texts into other languages and adaptation of the Contents to the CLASSGAP audience; and distribution, of photographs, texts, videos or any other Content that is subject to protection, according to current intellectual property legislation, for the sole purpose of being displayed and communicated on this Website, on any other of the company's websites, or on websites of companies affiliated to TusMedia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise, Users authorise Tus Media to proceed to the modification of texts and other Contents, in order to adapt them according to the specifications and technical requirements of CLASSGAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tus Media offers its Users the possibility that the Contents uploaded to CLASSGAP are shared and visualised in Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest and other social networks, in which case, they will be governed by the terms and conditions of these websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author can modify and eliminate the Content and/or materials whenever he wants, without prejudice that, if previously he has assigned rights to other Users, said Users, whether they are Students or co-teachers, considering "co-teachers" to those where a Teacher provides the materials or content for the class and another one makes use of said content or materials during the lesson, have the right to exploit that Content in an indeterminate way and the Content will be present in CLASSGAP for its use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the enrolment to a course, the Teacher is ceding the total use of the Contents and/or materials to the enrolled Students for purposes of personal but not commercial use. In case of observing that any User has infringed any intellectual or industrial property right of the Teacher, the Teacher can inform CLASSGAP so that it can adopt the appropriate measures. Likewise, if the Teacher wants to denounce such an infringement, he/she must do so before the competent authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.3. Co-teacher and transfer of intellectual property rights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated in section 2.2 above, the authors of the courses in Classgap automatically cede their courses for usufruct to other CLASSGAP teachers in exchange for an economic compensation that will be defined later and will be notified to the authors of the courses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Modifications</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tus Media may from time to time update and/or modify these Terms and Conditions. Such modification will be communicated on classgap.com in a conspicuous place, or to Students via email, such that use of the service after the date of posting will indicate your agreement to such modifications. Tus Media will notify Teachers fifteen (15) calendar days prior to any changes to these Terms and Conditions via email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tus Media reserves the right to make changes to the Terms and Conditions effective immediately in any of the following circumstances: (1) when it is necessary due to legal or security requirements; (2) when it results from any variation or adjustment of a technical nature in CLASSGAP, in the service itself or, where appropriate, in the auxiliary services; (3) when the change corresponds to the elimination or modification of elements that in the opinion of Tus Media do not allow preserving the security or are illicit, offensive, inappropriate or discriminatory and/or (4) when it is necessary to face an unforeseen and imminent danger related to the defence of the online intermediary services, the Students or the Teachers against fraud, malware, spam, data security breaches or other cybersecurity risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Use of the Website and Contents</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unauthorised use of the same may constitute a violation of intellectual or industrial property legislation or other applicable laws, and may give rise to the initiation of the corresponding administrative, extrajudicial or judicial proceedings.</p>

However, in the event that we use your name, we will request your prior consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You agree that you will have no recourse, directly or through third parties, against Tus Media for any alleged or actual infringement of any proprietary right by another User on classgap.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take into account that Tus Media will not be responsible for verifying the ownership of the CU incorporated by the Users to CLASSGAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Accepts that the Students may rate their Classes. Tus Media cannot control these evaluations and will not be responsible for the Content of these opinions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>11. Price of the service and promotional programmes</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 15.3333px">In consideration for the provision of services and the use of the platform, CLASSGAP will charge a commission to the teachers according to the level of Teacher they have in CLASSGAP at that moment:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15.3333px">There are 5 levels of Teacher, depending on the number of hours performed in CLASSGAP:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 15.3333px">&nbsp;Beginner teacher (&lt;25 hours), a 32% commission will be charged on the price of the lesson.</span></li>
<li>Intermediate teacher (25&lt;-&gt;59 hours), a 27% commission will be charged on the price of the lesson.</li>
<li>Advanced teacher (60&lt;-&gt;299 hours), a 23% commission will be charged on the lesson price.</li>
<li>Expert teacher (300&lt;-&gt;499 hours), a 18% commission will be charged on the lesson price.</li>
<li>Legend teacher (&gt;500 hours, during the last two years), a 16% commission will be charged on the lesson price.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 15.3333px">Once you have reached a category you can never go back to a lower one, except for the Legend category which is calculated based on the lessons you have given in the last two years. All other categories accumulate over time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>12. I am a teacher, how much does the service cost?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can set the price you want to receive per hour of class given. Tus Media will charge the fixed price with a percentage that varies depending on whether the contract is made through the Teacher or through the CLASSGAP Website and/or distributors contracted by Tus Media and/or affiliates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Through the Teacher: Tus Media will charge the price set by the Teacher with a 10% intermediary commission in the event that the booking is made through its own channels, via a link provided for this purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Through Tus Media or affiliates: Tus Media will charge a variable percentage as intermediation commission depending on the total number of hours carried out by the Teacher in CLASSGAP. You can consult the percentage in the following table:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the New and Professional Teacher, which are based on the overall number of hours in CLASSGAP, the Star Teacher is linked to the completion of a minimum of 250 hours in the last calendar year. The value of applying this percentage must be higher than 1.25€. If it is not, the minimum of €1.25 per hour will be applied. The above percentages include all costs and services offered by CLASSGAP, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Student Recruitment: we take care of finding you new students to teach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Charge management costs by: debit or credit card, Paypal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Payment security: we assure you that you will be paid for all the classes given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Use of the CLASSGAP Virtual Classroom where you can carry out the Classes, as well as monitoring and assessment tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Payment management costs: bank transfer or Paypal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Depending on the level of visibility you have chosen, your profile will be more or less visible and other fees will be applied to the first Class with each Student.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right at any time to change the commission for services (or to start charging for free services) provided that such changes are not retroactive to charges paid prior to the time of the change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>13. I am a teacher, when and how will I receive the amount of my classes?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of each month we will analyse the amount you have accumulated from classes taken more than 24 hours ago. There are two scenarios depending on the amount you have accumulated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You have accumulated more than 50 euros: We will make before the end of the month and free of charge an automatic transfer to your bank account (for EEC accounts) or to your Paypal account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. You have accumulated less than 50 euros: In this case we will keep the amount until the month you reach 50 euros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This duality in the method of payment is intended to save costs for all parties. Therefore, if the teacher resides outside the EEC countries, he/she must have set up a Paypal account in CLASSGAP to facilitate such payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Teacher must comply with their tax and other obligations arising from the sale of their courses. However, Tus Media is not responsible for monitoring compliance with these obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>14. What is my level of visibility as a tutor?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The visibility of your profile in the tutor grids depends on several factors:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The level of visibility selected from your personal area.</p>
<p>The quality of your profile, i.e. the number of Lessons conducted in CLASSGAP, your approval and message reply time, your conversion rate from free to paid Lessons.</p>
<p>Your current availability. You will not appear on the days you have marked as absent from your personal area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>15. Packages of tutoring hours</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers may optionally offer reduced tuition hour prices if the Student contracts packages of hours in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Packages will be for a minimum of 5 hours, and must be spent on 1 hour lessons. All packages are valid for 6 months, and are valid only with the selected Teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once one or more classes of a package have been completed, no refunds will be given, except in cases where the teacher certifies that he/she is unable to continue teaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>16. 20 min free trial lessons</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers may optionally offer students a 20-minute test. Students may book a 20-minute test free of charge with those teachers who have this option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A maximum of 3 simultaneous free bookings can be made per student.</p>
<p>A maximum of 1 free booking with the same teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>17. Cancellations and Refunds</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Student may request a full refund of the Class when:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The Teacher refuses to conduct the Class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The teacher does not show up at the agreed date and time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within these conditions, the deadline for requesting a refund will be 14 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the first 14 days of purchase, no refund will be accepted, having the sole and exclusive option of refund in the form of a credit balance with a validity period of 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The validity period for using the balance is 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that a student requests a full refund, CLASSGAP reserves the right not to pay the teacher for the class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tus Media, acts as a mere intermediary between the Students and the Teachers and is therefore not responsible for any claims that may arise in respect of cancellations or refunds made, errors in the same, or the Teacher's decision not to make them when the Class has taken place. In the event that the Student requests a refund of the price paid within 7 calendar days of booking the Class, provided that there are more than 48 hours left until the Class begins, and the Class has not taken place, Tus Media will study the reasons for the request and, if it considers them to be justified, may proceed with the refund, informing the Teacher of the reasons for the refund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Impersonate, interfere with or disrupt the service, servers or networks connected to the services or fail to comply with the requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the services.</p>
<p>Contacting a Teacher or other Pupil for any purpose other than a class through CLASSGAP.</p>
<p>Acting as a Student, contact and recruit other Users to join third party services that are competitors of Tus Media.</p>
<p>Using automated scripts to collect information or interact with CLASSGAP.</p>
<p>Use CLASSGAP to find a Teacher and then complete the reservation externally in order to avoid the obligation to pay the commission for the provision of CLASSGAP services.</p>
<p>Retrieve data systematically or from other CLASSGAP Contents to create, directly or indirectly, in individual or multiple downloads, a collection of data, either manually or by means of bots, crawlers or similar. Access, manipulate or use non-public areas of the website, the computer systems of CLASSGAP or the technical delivery systems of its suppliers.</p>
<p>Any attempt to test the vulnerability of any system or network of CLASSGAP or violate any security or authentication measure.</p>
<p>Collaborate with a third party to carry out any of the described conducts.</p>
<p>Tus Media will have the right to investigate and denounce any of the mentioned conducts, according to the law, as well as to collaborate with the authorities in the investigation of such actions. You acknowledge that Tus Media has no obligation to control your access or use of CLASSGAP or to review or edit the CU without prejudice of having the right to do so in order to operate, ensure compliance with the terms and applicable legislation, administrative, police or judicial requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tus Media reserves the right to remove or disable access to any Collective Content, at any time and without notice, if it considers that it may violate the terms or damage the Website, in accordance with the provisions of our Content Policy. We are not responsible for any delay or failure to remove such Content. You consent to such removal and waive any claim against Tus Media arising from such removal. You may not use your account to breach the security of another account or gain unauthorised access to another network or server. Some parts of the service may not be available to you or other Authorized Users. You will not interfere with other Users' use of the service. You agree that we may terminate without notice your registration, account or other affiliation with the service if you violate the above provisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For quality control and security purposes only, Classes through CLASSGAP may be recorded. Should this occur, the recordings will be stored for these purposes for 12 months before being deleted. No recorded Content will be disseminated, thus protecting all Users who are part of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. Transfer of image rights</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Website and/or the application, the Student may insert his/her image in his/her User profile. Consequently, the Student grants, on a non-exclusive and worldwide basis, to Tus Media, which accepts, the right to use his/her image for publication on the Website and/or the application without the right to any remuneration whatsoever. Tus Media is authorised to carry out the exploitation of the Users' image in any way it deems appropriate, including deciding not to carry it out, without this entailing any right to compensation whatsoever. All of the above is in accordance with the provisions of the applicable data protection regulations and Organic Law 1/1982, of 5 May, on the civil protection of the right to honour, personal and family privacy and one's own image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Additional Agreements between Teachers and Students</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These Terms and Conditions are additional to any agreement between the Teacher and the Student. Tus Media cannot control the performance of these agreements, in particular: their content, their accuracy and legality, or the obligations of the parties. For this reason, you agree to release Tus Media and its agents from any liability, both direct and indirect, which may arise in this respect, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>10. I am a student, how do I pay?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for you to take the class, you must first pay the price of the class. This payment will be made to Tus Media by credit card, Paypal or any other payment method available in your country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a debit/credit card holder, you can choose the option "Save details for future bookings" so that you do not have to re-enter them for future payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data will be collected by Tus Media in encrypted form and sent to Braintree, which handles remote electronic payment transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Braintree will store and process this data autonomously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You agree to pay the price of any confirmed booking and authorise your PayPal account to be debited or your credit card to be charged. Once the booking has been confirmed as completed, you will receive a confirmation email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that these payment methods may require you to be subject to their terms and conditions, which are different from those of CLASSGAP. Tus Media does not have any responsibility for the relationship that you maintain with these suppliers, therefore you will hold Tus Media harmless for any claim, cost, damages of any nature that is caused by or related in any way to the Supplier Services, or that is due to or is a consequence of the non-fulfilment of the obligations assumed by you with regard to this Supplier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, of the total amount paid by the Student, Tus Media will receive the part corresponding to its intermediation commission, while the remainder will be received by Tus Media as a mere depository with the obligation to pay the Teacher its fees. Consequently, the Teacher will be solely responsible for the quality of the class(es) given, as well as for the invoicing of the same to the Student. It should be noted that, with the exception of the first class held, the price of a class already held is non-refundable (see cancellation and refund policy for more information).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

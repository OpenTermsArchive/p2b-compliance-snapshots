        the Xiaomi Account User Agreement, and follow the on-screen prompts. <strong>You agree to provide true,

          caused by false or mistaken registration information or failure to update user information.</strong> You can
        find and update your account details in your account settings. <strong>You should register your account using
          your real identity.</strong> You will not be able to sign up for a Xiaomi Account if you include illegal or

        information as prompted on the registration page, read and agree to the terms of this Agreement, and complete
        all the registration procedures, you may obtain a Xiaomi Account and become a Xiaomi user.</p>
      <h3>2.2 Using your account</h3>
      <p><strong>2.2.1 You are responsible for all activity that happens on or through your account and the consequences

          information, and the purchase of products and services.</strong></p>
      <p>2.2.2 Your Xiaomi Account is for you only. Your account information includes both your personal details as well
        as Xiaomi business information. You may not directly or indirectly allow third parties to use your Xiaomi
        Account or access information on your account without Xiaomi's consent. Xiaomi reserves the right to terminate
        this user agreement or suspend access to our services if we reasonably believe, after examination following
        policy violation procedures and standards, that your account security is in danger, or that Xiaomi's information
        security may be compromised by the use of your account.</p>
      <p>2.2.3 When you use a third-party account to sign in to Xiaomi services, your third-party account is linked with

          can recover it by following our account recovery steps. You'll be asked to provide the required information to
          verify the account is yours. We won't be able to process your request if the info you provided is inaccurate,
          invalid, or incomplete.</strong></p>
      <p>2.3.2 If you're using an account that was not created via Xiaomi or by you, but you know the password of the

<h2>2. WHAT WE DO</h2>
Through our Platform, Foodora links you to the Vendors for you to order a variety of Goods to be delivered to you or, where available, picked up by you from the Vendors’ premises. When you place an Order, Foodora acts as an intermediary between you and the Vendor, to facilitate, process and conclude the Order and, subsequently for either us or the Vendor to deliver your Order to you or, if available, to be picked up by you. In cases where delivery is provided by the Vendor, this will be indicated in the listing for each respective Vendor. Unless otherwise specified, delivery of your Order is carried out by us.<br><br>
<strong>Vendor listings</strong>: Vendors have the option to pay for preferential ranking of their listing in the page displaying the available restaurants / shops to customers, as well as in search results. Such listings are tagged as “promoted”. Other than listings marked as "promoted", and unless the customer uses the option to filter or sort listings in a particular order (e.g. “sort by: price high to low”), any search results and/or Vendor listings are displayed in a random order and not given any preferential ranking.<br><br>
Unless otherwise stated on the Vendor’s menu page, Vendors are “traders” under applicable consumer laws and statutory EU consumer rights will apply to your contract with Vendors.</p>

<p>6.2 <u>PLACING AN ORDER</u></p>
<p>You can only place an Order if you are logged-in in your Account. To complete an Order, follow the onscreen instructions after clicking ‘Checkout’. You may be required to provide additional details for us to complete your Order. You are required to review and confirm that all the information you provide, including the amounts, delivery details, personal details, payment information, and voucher codes (if applicable) is true, accurate and complete before you click “Order and pay”. An Order is successfully placed when you receive an email confirmation.</p>

<p>6.3 <u>ORDER PROCESS</u></p>
<p>When you place an Order on our Platform you are making an offer to the Vendor. The contract is concluded between you and the Vendor after the Vendor accepts your offer. After the conclusion of the contract you will be notified by us by sending you a confirmation by in-app notification or any other means you authorized in your account settings. You will receive your receipt/invoice per email once the Order is delivered to you. In case of a pre-order you will receive your receipt/invoice per e-mail once the Order is placed. Where applicable, Orders will include delivery fees, a service fee and any applicable tax (e.g. value-added tax etc.). Foodora will issue the invoice for the Goods and - in case of a Vendor Delivery - for the delivery fee on behalf and in the name of the Vendor. For its own services, including the service fee as detailed in section 10.5 of these Terms and, where delivery is carried out by us, the delivery fee, Foodora will invoice you in its own name.</p>

<p>6.4 <u>MINIMUM ORDER VALUE</u></p>
<p>Some of our Vendors require a minimum order value (“MOV”) before an Order can be placed and delivered to you. Where an applicable Order fails to meet the MOV, you will have the option of paying the difference to meet the MOV or to add more Goods to your Order.</p>

<p>6.5 <u>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS</u></p>

Nothing in this section shall affect your statutory right of withdrawal as set out in section 24.3.</p>

<h2>7. DELIVERY</h2>
<p>7.1 <u>DELIVERY AREAS</u></p>
<p>You understand that our Vendors offer their Goods in specific delivery areas and our Vendors vary from delivery area to delivery area. By entering your delivery address on the Platform, you will see the Vendors that we make available to you at that time. Delivery areas may expand, shrink or change depending on different conditions such as: weather, traffic, situations of force majeure, etc.</p>

<p>7.2 <u>DELIVERY TIME</u></p>
<p>Foodora (or, in the instances referred to in section 2 above, the Vendor) shall deliver your Order to the delivery address provided by you. If indicated on the Platform as available, you may choose for your Order to be delivered “ASAP” or scheduled for a specific time (pre-order). An estimated delivery time will be provided to you in your email confirmation as well as on the order tracking page. However, delivery times shall vary depending on factors that are not controllable (e.g. order quantity, distance, time of day (peak periods), weather conditions, traffic conditions, etc.). You can view the remaining delivery time of an Order when you click on ‘My orders’ on the Platform. You acknowledge that the delivery time we provide is only an estimate and Orders may arrive earlier or later. To ensure that you do not miss a delivery of an Order, you should ensure that either you or your representative is at the delivery location to receive the Order once an Order is placed. If your Order contains any Restricted Goods (as this term is defined below in section 9.1) and you or your representative are not of the minimum legal age, or fail to provide a valid proof of ID, Foodora reserves the right not to deliver your Order to you or your representative, subject to section 7 of these Terms.</p>

<p>7.3 <u>UNSUCCESSFUL OR FAILED DELIVERIES</u></p>
<p>Without prejudice to any other clauses in these Terms, in cases where we attempt to deliver an Order but we are unable to do so due to the reasons caused by you, including but not limited to:<br><br>
<strong>7.3.1</strong> no one was present or available to receive the Order at the address or location specified by you within a reasonable time;<br><br>

we will contact you via, among others, in-app call or message, or email, to inform the unsuccessful delivery and next steps. In such cases, Foodora reserves the right to cancel the Order without refund or remedy to you. Nothing in this section shall affect your statutory right of withdrawal as set out in section 24.3.</p>

<p>7.4 <u>WRONG ORDER, MISSING ITEMS, DEFECTIVE GOODS</u></p>
<p>Upon receipt of your Order, if you discover that there are issues with your Order (e.g. wrong order, defective order, or missing items) please contact customer support via our in-app customer support chat feature immediately. In some cases, Foodora may request for photographic proof and/or additional information to properly investigate the issue with your Order. If we determine that the Order and/or Goods you received are not of satisfactory condition or quality, we will compensate you for your Order or parts of your Order.</p>

<p>7.5 <u>VENDOR DELIVERY</u></p>
<p>In some cases, our Vendors will deliver the Order to you (“Vendor Delivery”). You will be informed about such cases on our platform under the relevant Vendor page. Where Vendor Delivery applies, we may ask you to contact the Vendor directly in the event of issues or delays in your delivery. Foodora shall not be responsible in any way for Orders or Goods that are delivered by Vendors if not provided otherwise in section 16 of this Agreement.</p>

<p>7.6 <u>CONTACTLESS DELIVERY</u></p>
<p>As one of the delivery options, the customer may select (for some of the offered Goods) contactless delivery (the delivery of the Order to the front door of a specified delivery address without face-to-face interaction for instance). Foodora shall not be liable for theft, damage, contamination and/or other deterioration of the Goods that occur after delivery has taken place.</p>

<h2>8. PICK-UP</h2>
<p>8.1 <u>PICK-UP PROCESS</u></p>

Your email confirmation will indicate the time for you to Pick-Up the Order (“Collection Time”). The Vendor will prepare the Order by the Collection Time. In some cases, a reasonable delay may be expected. The Vendor agrees to hold the Order for you at the Vendor’s premises for no more than a reasonable period of thirty (30) minutes from the Collection Time (“Holding Time”) and shall not be obliged to provide the Order to you if you fail to Pick-Up your Order within the Holding Time.</p>
  
<p>8.2 <u>PICK-UP LIABILITY</u></p>
<p>In the event of unreasonable delays in Pick-Up attributable to you, you bear the risk of any damage or loss of Goods or any deterioration in quality or change in condition of the Goods (e.g. changes in the temperature fit for consumption). In this case, you shall not be entitled to a refund or replacement of the Goods. You alone are responsible for inspecting the Goods/Order when you Pick-Up your Order and shall report any issues and/or defects to the Vendor before leaving the Vendor’s premises.</p>

Hasle 8210 Aarhus V, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="543f213a3031273126223d373114323b3b303b26357a303f">[email&#160;protected]</a>) of your decision to withdraw the contract with the Vendor by means of a clear declaration (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail). You can use the attached model withdrawal form for this purpose, which is, however, not mandatory.</p>

<p>24.3.2 <u>CONSEQUENCES OF THE WITHDRAWAL</u><br><br>
24.3.2.1 If you withdraw the contract with the Vendor in accordance with section 24.3.1, the Vendor must repay you all payments that they have received from you, including the delivery costs (with the exception of the additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of delivery other than the cheapest standard delivery offered by us), without delay and at the latest within 14 (fourteen) days from the day on which we received the notification of your withdrawal of the contract. For this repayment, the Vendor will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will you be charged for this repayment.<br><br>
24.3.2.2 The Vendor may refuse repayment until they have received the Goods back or until you have provided proof that you have returned the Goods, whichever is earlier.<br><br>
24.3.2.3 You bear the direct costs of returning the Goods.<br><br>
24.3.2.4 You only have to pay for any loss in value of the Goods if this loss in value is due to handling of the Goods that is not necessary for testing the quality, characteristics and functioning of the Goods.</p>

Where applicable, Orders will include delivery fees, a service fee and any applicable tax (e.g. value-added tax etc.). Foodora will issue the invoice for the Goods and - in case of a Vendor Delivery - for the delivery fee on behalf and in the name of the Vendor. For its own services, including the service fee as detailed in section 10.5 of these Terms and, where delivery is carried out by us, the delivery fee, Foodora will invoice you in its own name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.4 <u>MINIMUM ORDER VALUE</u></p>\r\n<p>Some of our Vendors require a minimum order value (“MOV”) before an Order can be placed and delivered to you. Where an applicable Order fails to meet the MOV, you will have the option of paying the difference to meet the MOV or to add more Goods to your Order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.5 <u>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS</u></p>\r\n<p>The Vendor will comply with your special instructions for an Order, if it is feasible, possible and commercially reasonable.

You have the right to cancel your Order provided a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. In addition, you may be entitled to a right of withdrawal in accordance with section 24, which is not affected by the provisions of this clause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.8 <u>REFUNDS</u></p>\r\n<p>You have the right to a refund for a cancelled Order only if a Vendor has not yet accepted your Order. Should you still decide to cancel your Order after it has been accepted by the Vendor, you understand that no refunds (whether in whole or in part) will be issued to you and you forfeit the delivery of your cancelled Order. Nothing in this section shall affect your statutory right of withdrawal as set out in section 24.3.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. DELIVERY</h2>\r\n<p>7.1 <u>DELIVERY AREAS</u></p>\r\n<p>You understand that our Vendors offer their Goods in specific delivery areas and our Vendors vary from delivery area to delivery area. By entering your delivery address on the Platform, you will see the Vendors that we make available to you at that time. Delivery areas may expand, shrink or change depending on different conditions such as: weather, traffic, situations of force majeure, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.2 <u>DELIVERY TIME</u></p>\r\n<p>Foodora (or, in the instances referred to in section 2 above, the Vendor) shall deliver your Order to the delivery address provided by you. If indicated on the Platform as available, you may choose for your Order to be delivered “ASAP” or scheduled for a specific time (pre-order). An estimated delivery time will be provided to you in your email confirmation as well as on the order tracking page. However, delivery times shall vary depending on factors that are not controllable (e.g. order quantity, distance, time of day (peak periods), weather conditions, traffic conditions, etc.). You can view the remaining delivery time of an Order when you click on ‘My orders’ on the Platform. You acknowledge that the delivery time we provide is only an estimate and Orders may arrive earlier or later. To ensure that you do not miss a delivery of an Order, you should ensure that either you or your representative is at the delivery location to receive the Order once an Order is placed. If your Order contains any Restricted Goods (as this term is defined below in section 9.1) and you or your representative are not of the minimum legal age, or fail to provide a valid proof of ID, Foodora reserves the right not to deliver your Order to you or your representative, subject to section 7 of these Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.3 <u>UNSUCCESSFUL OR FAILED DELIVERIES</u></p>\r\n<p>Without prejudice to any other clauses in these Terms, in cases where we attempt to deliver an Order but we are unable to do so due to the reasons caused by you, including but not limited to:<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.1</strong> no one was present or available to receive the Order at the address or location specified by you within a reasonable time;<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.2</strong> customer was uncontactable despite attempts to reach the customer via the phone number provided;<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.3</strong> lack of appropriate or sufficient access to deliver the Order successfully;<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.4</strong> lack of a suitable or secure location to leave or deliver the Order; or<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.5</strong> failed age-verification in the case of Restricted Goods, you are not of legal age or delivery person did not deem it safe or appropriate for you to receive the Restricted Goods;<br><br>\r\nwe will contact you via, among others, in-app call or message, or email, to inform the unsuccessful delivery and next steps. In such cases, Foodora reserves the right to cancel the Order without refund or remedy to you. Nothing in this section shall affect your statutory right of withdrawal as set out in section 24.3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.4 <u>WRONG ORDER, MISSING ITEMS, DEFECTIVE GOODS</u></p>\r\n<p>Upon receipt of your Order, if you discover that there are issues with your Order (e.g. wrong order, defective order, or missing items) please contact customer support via our in-app customer support chat feature immediately. In some cases, Foodora may request for photographic proof and/or additional information to properly investigate the issue with your Order. If we determine that the Order and/or Goods you received are not of satisfactory condition or quality, we will compensate you for your Order or parts of your Order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.5 <u>VENDOR DELIVERY</u></p>\r\n<p>In some cases, our Vendors will deliver the Order to you (“Vendor Delivery”). You will be informed about such cases on our platform under the relevant Vendor page. Where Vendor Delivery applies, we may ask you to contact the Vendor directly in the event of issues or delays in your delivery. Foodora shall not be responsible in any way for Orders or Goods that are delivered by Vendors if not provided otherwise in section 16 of this Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.6 <u>CONTACTLESS DELIVERY</u></p>\r\n<p>As one of the delivery options, the customer may select (for some of the offered Goods) contactless delivery (the delivery of the Order to the front door of a specified delivery address without face-to-face interaction for instance). Foodora shall not be liable for theft, damage, contamination and/or other deterioration of the Goods that occur after delivery has taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. PICK-UP</h2>\r\n<p>8.1 <u>PICK-UP PROCESS</u></p>\r\n<p>Where available as indicated on the Platform, you will have the option of collecting your Order in-person directly from the Vendor’s premises (\"Pick-Up\") instead of having the Order delivered to you. Your email confirmation will indicate the time for you to Pick-Up the Order (“Collection Time”). The Vendor will prepare the Order by the Collection Time. In some cases, a reasonable delay may be expected. The Vendor agrees to hold the Order for you at the Vendor’s premises for no more than a reasonable period of thirty (30) minutes from the Collection Time (“Holding Time”) and shall not be obliged to provide the Order to you if you fail to Pick-Up your Order within the Holding Time.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>8.2 <u>PICK-UP LIABILITY</u></p>\r\n<p>In the event of unreasonable delays in Pick-Up attributable to you, you bear the risk of any damage or loss of Goods or any deterioration in quality or change in condition of the Goods (e.g. changes in the temperature fit for consumption). In this case, you shall not be entitled to a refund or replacement of the Goods. You alone are responsible for inspecting the Goods/Order when you Pick-Up your Order and shall report any issues and/or defects to the Vendor before leaving the Vendor’s premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>9. RESTRICTIONS ON GOODS</h2>\r\n<p>9.1 <u>RESTRICTED GOODS</u></p>\r\n<p>Some of the Goods such as - but not limited to - alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical, that the Vendors offer on our Platform may be subject to restrictions for purchase (“Restricted Goods”). These restrictions may include, among others, the following  requirements for certain products. In case other restrictions apply you will be informed about this on our Platform directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.2 <u>AGE REQUIREMENTS AND PROOF THEREOF</u></p>\r\n<p>Where there exists a statutory legal age to purchase Restricted Goods, Foodora, the riders, the Vendor and their delivery riders, as the case may be, reserve the right to:<br><br>\r\n<strong>9.2.1</strong> ask for valid proof of your age (e.g. ID card) upon delivery; and/or<br><br>\r\n<strong>9.2.2</strong> refuse delivery if you are unable to prove you are of legal age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.3 <u>OTHER RESTRICTIONS</u></p>\r\n<p>In some circumstances other restrictions apply when purchasing Restricted Goods. In these instances, Foodora, the riders, the Vendor and their delivery riders, as the case may be, reserve the right to:<br><br>\r\n<strong>9.3.1</strong> ask for a valid medical prescription (in the case of pharmaceuticals);<br><br>\r\n<strong>9.3.2</strong> ask for proof or validation of any other applicable restriction as specified on the Platform directly; and/or<br><br>\r\n<strong>9.3.3</strong> refuse delivery to any person for any reason whatsoever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.4 <u>NO CONTACTLESS DELIVERY</u></p>\r\n<p>For Restricted Goods there is no “contactless delivery”, “just drop them at the door delivery” or other similar delivery available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>10. PRICES</h2>\r\n<p>10.1 <u>PRICE AND TAXES</u></p>\r\n<p>Prices quoted on the Platform by the Vendors are displayed in Danish Krone (DKK) and are subject to applicable tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.2 <u>DISPLAY OF PRICES</u></p>\r\n<p>Subject to applicable laws, the prices reflected on our Platform always include VAT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.3 <u>CHECKOUT</u></p>\r\n<p>A breakdown of the prices and additional charges are displayed before Checkout. When you place an Order, you agree to all amounts, additional charges and the final ‘Total’ amount which is displayed to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.4 <u>DELIVERY FEES</u></p>\r\n<p>Delivery fees are chargeable on every Order unless:<br><br>\r\n<strong>10.4.1</strong> you opt to collect your Order directly from the Vendor (“Pick up”);<br><br>\r\n<strong>10.4.2</strong> you have a valid promotional or discount voucher and apply it at Checkout; or<br><br>\r\n<strong>10.4.3</strong> it is stated otherwise on the Platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.5 <u>SERVICE FEES</u></p>\r\n<p>Foodora charges a service fee. This service fee will be used to constantly improve our overall service/performance, including providing you with a wider choice of Vendors and around the clock customer service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.6 <u>PRICE CHANGES</u></p>\r\n<p>Prices indicated on the Platform are as at the time of each Order and may be subject to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.7 <u>DEPOSIT</u></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>10.7.1</strong> Any amounts of deposits on beverage containers will automatically be added to the prices of the Goods. The amount of the deposit will be indicated under the price of the Good before ordering and again be displayed during Checkout.<br><br>\r\n<strong>10.7.1</strong> You can return all containers with returnable deposits to the respective Vendor or any of its affiliated locations, as notified by the Vendor, at any time during the opening hours of such Vendors. However, you cannot give the riders returnable containers to carry them to the relevant Vendors’ locations.<br><br>\r\n<strong>10.7.1</strong> Respective deposits may be refunded at the Vendors’ premises, subject to the respective Vendors’ terms and conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>11. PAYMENT</h2>\r\n<p>11.1 <u>PAYMENT OBLIGATION</u></p>\r\n<p>By virtue of the remote sales services and of the contract concluded between you and the Vendor on the basis of your Order, you have a purchase price payment obligation towards the Vendor and an obligation to pay a delivery fee and a service fee to Foodora or the Vendor, both of which you can fulfill by using your Account as a payment instrument as described above at Section 3.2. When using your Account as payment instrument you may choose from different payment methods as available and indicated on the Platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.2 <u>VOUCHERS</u></p>\r\n<p>If you have valid promotional or discount Vouchers, you can use these to pay for part or all of your Order as the case may be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.3 <u>ADDITIONAL PAYMENT METHODS</u></p>\r\n<p>Foodora reserves the right to offer additional payment methods and/or remove existing payment methods at any time at its sole discretion. If you choose to pay using an online payment method, the payment shall be processed by our third party payment service provider(s). With your consent, your credit card / payment information will be stored with our third party payment service provider(s) for future Orders. Foodora does not store your credit card or payment information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.4 <u>PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</u></p>\r\n<p>You must ensure that you have sufficient funds on your credit and debit card to fulfill payment of an Order, if you choose these payment options. Insofar as required, Foodora takes responsibility for payments made on our Platform including refunds, chargebacks, cancellations and dispute resolution, provided if reasonable and justifiable and in accordance with these Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.5 <u>NO PAYMENT SERVICES</u></p>\r\n<p>Foodora does not provide any payment service either to you or to third parties. All online payments are processed via your own issuer / payment service provider and the payment service providers in partnership with Foodora.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>12. VOLUNTARY TIP</h2>\r\n<p>The Tip is intended for the riders and cannot be considered as payment for the Goods. Foodora will therefore only collect the Tip on behalf of the rider. The Tip-function is only available for deliveries made by Foodora itself or by a company affiliated with Foodora, but not for Vendor Delivery, as indicated on the Platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>13. VOUCHERS, DISCOUNTS AND PROMOTIONS</h2>\r\n<p>13.1 <u>MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS</u></p>\r\n<p>From time to time, Foodora may run marketing and promotional campaigns which offer voucher codes, discounts, and other promotional offers to be used on the Platform (“<strong>Vouchers</strong>”).

We will always inform you of such exclusions before you are bound by the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13.7 <u>ACTIVITIES AND CONDUCTS PROHIBITED</u></p>\r\n<p>Regarding the right to receive coupon discount or the right to obtain coupons, resales to and/or any other conducts of delivering or receiving considerations with third parties, in any manner (including in an online flea market), are prohibited.

The greater the popularity of a [Partner] (based on the above criteria), the higher it will be listed. \n\nPaid placement:\nThe order of search results may also be affected by paid placement [and marketing and campaigns], and relevant Partners will be marked as such. \n\nFor a more detailed description please see our terms and conditions.\n","NEXTGEN_CLOSE":"Close","location.map.title":"What's your exact location?","postal_code.your_postal_code":"Your street and street number","location.map.tooltip":"We'll deliver here","NEXTGEN_MAP_SUBMIT":"FIND RESTAURANTS","add_new_address_title":"Add New Address","no_saved_addresses_hint":"Enter an address to see restaurants and shops available to you","location.error.address_empty":"What's your delivery address?","location.error.address_not_found":"This doesn't seem right.

Nothing in this section shall affect your statutory right of withdrawal as set out in section 24.3.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. DELIVERY</h2>\r\n<p>7.1 <u>DELIVERY AREAS</u></p>\r\n<p>You understand that our Vendors offer their Goods in specific delivery areas and our Vendors vary from delivery area to delivery area. By entering your delivery address on the Platform, you will see the Vendors that we make available to you at that time. Delivery areas may expand, shrink or change depending on different conditions such as: weather, traffic, situations of force majeure, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.2 <u>DELIVERY TIME</u></p>\r\n<p>Foodora (or, in the instances referred to in section 2 above, the Vendor) shall deliver your Order to the delivery address provided by you. If indicated on the Platform as available, you may choose for your Order to be delivered “ASAP” or scheduled for a specific time (pre-order). An estimated delivery time will be provided to you in your email confirmation as well as on the order tracking page. However, delivery times shall vary depending on factors that are not controllable (e.g. order quantity, distance, time of day (peak periods), weather conditions, traffic conditions, etc.). You can view the remaining delivery time of an Order when you click on ‘My orders’ on the Platform. You acknowledge that the delivery time we provide is only an estimate and Orders may arrive earlier or later. To ensure that you do not miss a delivery of an Order, you should ensure that either you or your representative is at the delivery location to receive the Order once an Order is placed. If your Order contains any Restricted Goods (as this term is defined below in section 9.1) and you or your representative are not of the minimum legal age, or fail to provide a valid proof of ID, Foodora reserves the right not to deliver your Order to you or your representative, subject to section 7 of these Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.3 <u>UNSUCCESSFUL OR FAILED DELIVERIES</u></p>\r\n<p>Without prejudice to any other clauses in these Terms, in cases where we attempt to deliver an Order but we are unable to do so due to the reasons caused by you, including but not limited to:<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.1</strong> no one was present or available to receive the Order at the address or location specified by you within a reasonable time;<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.2</strong> customer was uncontactable despite attempts to reach the customer via the phone number provided;<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.3</strong> lack of appropriate or sufficient access to deliver the Order successfully;<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.4</strong> lack of a suitable or secure location to leave or deliver the Order; or<br><br>\r\n<strong>7.3.5</strong> failed age-verification in the case of Restricted Goods, you are not of legal age or delivery person did not deem it safe or appropriate for you to receive the Restricted Goods;<br><br>\r\nwe will contact you via, among others, in-app call or message, or email, to inform the unsuccessful delivery and next steps.

Nothing in this section shall affect your statutory right of withdrawal as set out in section 24.3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.4 <u>WRONG ORDER, MISSING ITEMS, DEFECTIVE GOODS</u></p>\r\n<p>Upon receipt of your Order, if you discover that there are issues with your Order (e.g. wrong order, defective order, or missing items) please contact customer support via our in-app customer support chat feature immediately. In some cases, Foodora may request for photographic proof and/or additional information to properly investigate the issue with your Order. If we determine that the Order and/or Goods you received are not of satisfactory condition or quality, we will compensate you for your Order or parts of your Order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.5 <u>VENDOR DELIVERY</u></p>\r\n<p>In some cases, our Vendors will deliver the Order to you (“Vendor Delivery”). You will be informed about such cases on our platform under the relevant Vendor page. Where Vendor Delivery applies, we may ask you to contact the Vendor directly in the event of issues or delays in your delivery. Foodora shall not be responsible in any way for Orders or Goods that are delivered by Vendors if not provided otherwise in section 16 of this Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.6 <u>CONTACTLESS DELIVERY</u></p>\r\n<p>As one of the delivery options, the customer may select (for some of the offered Goods) contactless delivery (the delivery of the Order to the front door of a specified delivery address without face-to-face interaction for instance). Foodora shall not be liable for theft, damage, contamination and/or other deterioration of the Goods that occur after delivery has taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. PICK-UP</h2>\r\n<p>8.1 <u>PICK-UP PROCESS</u></p>\r\n<p>Where available as indicated on the Platform, you will have the option of collecting your Order in-person directly from the Vendor’s premises (\"Pick-Up\") instead of having the Order delivered to you. Your email confirmation will indicate the time for you to Pick-Up the Order (“Collection Time”). The Vendor will prepare the Order by the Collection Time. In some cases, a reasonable delay may be expected. The Vendor agrees to hold the Order for you at the Vendor’s premises for no more than a reasonable period of thirty (30) minutes from the Collection Time (“Holding Time”) and shall not be obliged to provide the Order to you if you fail to Pick-Up your Order within the Holding Time.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>8.2 <u>PICK-UP LIABILITY</u></p>\r\n<p>In the event of unreasonable delays in Pick-Up attributable to you, you bear the risk of any damage or loss of Goods or any deterioration in quality or change in condition of the Goods (e.g. changes in the temperature fit for consumption). In this case, you shall not be entitled to a refund or replacement of the Goods. You alone are responsible for inspecting the Goods/Order when you Pick-Up your Order and shall report any issues and/or defects to the Vendor before leaving the Vendor’s premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>9.

This service fee will be used to constantly improve our overall service/performance, including providing you with a wider choice of Vendors and around the clock customer service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.6 <u>PRICE CHANGES</u></p>\r\n<p>Prices indicated on the Platform are as at the time of each Order and may be subject to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.7 <u>DEPOSIT</u></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>10.7.1</strong> Any amounts of deposits on beverage containers will automatically be added to the prices of the Goods.

PAYMENT</h2>\r\n<p>11.1 <u>PAYMENT OBLIGATION</u></p>\r\n<p>By virtue of the remote sales services and of the contract concluded between you and the Vendor on the basis of your Order, you have a purchase price payment obligation towards the Vendor and an obligation to pay a delivery fee and a service fee to Foodora or the Vendor, both of which you can fulfill by using your Account as a payment instrument as described above at Section 3.2. When using your Account as payment instrument you may choose from different payment methods as available and indicated on the Platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.2 <u>VOUCHERS</u></p>\r\n<p>If you have valid promotional or discount Vouchers, you can use these to pay for part or all of your Order as the case may be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.3 <u>ADDITIONAL PAYMENT METHODS</u></p>\r\n<p>Foodora reserves the right to offer additional payment methods and/or remove existing payment methods at any time at its sole discretion.

All online payments are processed via your own issuer / payment service provider and the payment service providers in partnership with Foodora.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>12. VOLUNTARY TIP</h2>\r\n<p>The Tip is intended for the riders and cannot be considered as payment for the Goods. Foodora will therefore only collect the Tip on behalf of the rider. The Tip-function is only available for deliveries made by Foodora itself or by a company affiliated with Foodora, but not for Vendor Delivery, as indicated on the Platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>13. VOUCHERS, DISCOUNTS AND PROMOTIONS</h2>\r\n<p>13.1 <u>MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS</u></p>\r\n<p>From time to time, Foodora may run marketing and promotional campaigns which offer voucher codes, discounts, and other promotional offers to be used on the Platform (“<strong>Vouchers</strong>”).

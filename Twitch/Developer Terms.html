<h4 id="schedule-1"><strong>SCHEDULE 1</strong></h4>

<p>The terms of this Schedule apply if you use the Twitch APIs. “Twitch APIs” means any of the Program Materials we make available to use Twitch’s application programming interfaces, embeddable players, and other materials, specifically found here: <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/">https://dev.twitch.tv</a>.</p>

<p>For clarity, analytics data, or metadata that we make available via both Twitch APIs as well as other methods – for example, a CSV file export, visualizations, graphs, charts, etc. –&nbsp; in connection with end user activity on twitch.tv pertaining to Your Services are all considered “Program Materials” for the purposes of this Agreement. The terms in this Schedule are designed to provide you with policies, requirements, and rules for developing Your Services, including without limitation tools that use and interact with Twitch’s applications, services, APIs, content, community, website. Our aim is to provide developers with tools and services to build services and products that enrich, inform, enhance, and evolve functionality on Twitch in a transparent manner that respects the expectations of end users. To that end, you must be honest about your relationship with Twitch, ensure end users understand your identity and the purpose of Your Services, and make it easy for people to contact you and promptly respond to questions and requests. Put simply - we want Your Services to provide user experiences that delight the community.</p>

<p><strong>A. Data &amp; Publishing Permissions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You must only request access to the data and publishing permissions necessary to implement Your Services’ current features or services.

  <li>If you are tracking an end user’s activity or using other behavioral advertising techniques, you must disclose that you are doing so and provide an opt-out mechanism.</li>
  <li>At all times you must comply with your privacy notice in the collection, use, display, sharing, and storage of information.</li>
  <li>If Your Services allow end users to post content to Twitch, then, before publishing, you must preview to the end user what will be published on Twitch.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>B. Inappropriate &amp; Appropriate Commercial Uses</strong></p>

<p>The following activities are prohibited, absent a separate agreement with Twitch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using data collected from the Twitch APIs to target end users with marketing material or commercial offers available off the Twitch Services.</li>
  <li>Creating demographic clusters for the purpose of contacting or targeting Twitch’s end users on or off the Twitch Services.</li>
  <li>Transferring profile content or end user data to any advertising network, data broker, or other advertising or monetization-related service. This includes, using profile content or data of an end user of Twitch Services, by itself or bundled with third-party data or other data you collect, to target end users with advertising outside of the Twitch Services.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Selling, licensing, or otherwise distributing any metadata or social content, or authorizing access to any metadata or social content, directly or indirectly (<em>e.g.</em>, through multiple tiers of distribution), to anybody – including data about purchases that end users make on the Twitch Services.</li>

</ul>

<p>Twitch will consider authorizing you to use the Twitch APIs to engage in the following activities only after entering into a separate agreement and running through an approval process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marketing - services used by marketers, promoters, or their customers for marketing campaigns, campaign analysis, or anything similar.</li>
  <li>Research - educational and non-commercial projects that examine trends over specific time periods.</li>
</ul>

  <li>You must delete all data of an end user collected through the Twitch APIs upon termination of this Agreement, revocation, or reduction in scope of end user authorization, or upon Twitch’s or the end user’s request, and cause any affiliates or third parties with whom you have shared copies with Twitch’s prior written permission to do the same, unless you are required to keep it by law, regulation, or separate agreement with us.</li>
  <li>Do not store copies of Twitch Content or Program Materials, unless you: (a) obtain prior written authorization from Twitch (through these terms or otherwise); (b) control the rights associated with such content; or (c) cache such information for only a twenty-four hour time period without further sharing it with third parties.</li>

<ul>
  <li>We encourage you to use Twitch’s embeddable products to showcase Twitch Content. However, you must obtain authorization from the applicable Twitch end users before using their channels’ content to market or promote a commercial product or service. Twitch does not own all Twitch Content provided by its end users, and offering Program Materials that allow you to reproduce or display Twitch Content is not an express or implied license to the content from Twitch.</li>
  <li>You must adopt and integrate our embeddable player for all Twitch video content. You may not use any other player or system to display Twitch video content without Twitch’s prior written permission.</li>
  <li>Do not modify, replace, interfere with, limit, block, cover, or obscure: (a) the functionality of embeddable experiences, including advertisements within the player; or (b) the Twitch Marks.</li>
  <li>We encourage you to use the Twitch embed autoplay feature where the embed is positioned as a focus of the user experience. Twitch may disable autoplay when the embed is not relevant or related to the user experience, meaning the embed is hidden, obscured, or located at the bottom of a page, and/or where a primary purpose of the embed placement is to inflate viewer count on a Twitch Channel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prohibited Uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitch embeds must not be used on websites that (a) have a primary purpose to share or host content that would violate Twitch’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a>; (b) attempt to replicate the Twitch experience without offering additional content or data of substantial value on the same page; or (c) target children under 13.</li>
  <li>You must not transmit embeddable experiences to or through any advertising network or other advertising-related service.</li>
  <li>You must not create or implement embeddable experiences in exchange for any compensation (monetary or non-monetary, directly or indirectly) from a content provider on a site or service that the content provider does not own or operate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Permitted Commercial Uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advertising is permitted on the same website as Twitch’s embeddable experiences so long as other content or data of substantial value appears on the same page.</li>
  <li>You can charge end users for access to Your Services that include Twitch embeddable experiences, but cannot charge fees specifically for the ability to watch or access those experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Chat</strong></p>

<p>We consider chat to be an essential component of the broadcast experience on Twitch. It is our belief, and we hope this informs your thinking, that Twitch broadcasters should be able to do the following with chat:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exercise control over their channel environment.</li>
  <li>Cast a net for input from viewers.</li>
  <li>Create a feedback loop with viewers.</li>
  <li>Accomplish tasks (polls, giveaways, enforce spam filters, answer questions).</li>
  <li>Trigger viewing experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific requirements with Chat:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must position any end user authentication method in a clear and conspicuous location to ensure end users consent to initiating chat conversations.</li>
  <li>You must enable, and process, all requests by end users to block, discontinue, or otherwise opt-out of chat communications.</li>
  <li>You must not design bots that engage in offensive or deceptive practices (<em>e.g.</em>, generate hate speech, send spam, offer false follows, etc.) or otherwise violate Twitch’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You must only retain chat logs as long as necessary for the operation of Your Services or to improve Your Services; do not do so for the purpose of creating public databases or websites, or, in general, to collect information about Twitch’s end users. You must enable, and process, all requests by end users to block, discontinue, delete, or otherwise opt-out of any retention of chat logs for Your Services.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="schedule-2"><strong>SCHEDULE 2</strong></h4>

<p>The terms of this Schedule apply if you participate in Twitch Extensions.</p>

<p>In the event of conflict or inconsistency between this Schedule 2 and the body of this Agreement or another Schedule thereto, the order of precedence will be: this Agreement, Schedule 2, and any other Schedule. This Schedule 2 includes all terms, rules, and policies that we make available for participating and using the Program Materials associated with Twitch Extensions, including the documentation available from the Twitch Developer Site, in particular, located at <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/">https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/</a>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this Schedule 2, the term “Extension” means Your Services that are licensed, sold, distributed, or promoted on the twitch.tv web application, or its mobile, television, and console equivalents, in connection with Twitch Extensions.</p>

<p>Policies, requirements, and rules regarding your participation in Twitch Extensions follow:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for all aspects, legal or otherwise, of managing the relationship with the broadcaster as it relates to the use of your Extension. Deprecating, discontinuing, or taking down your Extension, either by you or Twitch, does not affect the rights of broadcasters who have entered into a contract with you or paid you for the use of that Extension or your obligations thereunder, including delivery and support.</li>
  <li>When submitting your Extension to Twitch, you: (a) may include a reference to terms, such as terms of service or an end user license agreement (EULA), that govern your Extension and broadcasters’ rights thereto; and (b) must include a reference to a reasonable privacy policy or notice, if you: (i) intend to collect viewer or broadcaster data that constitutes personal data, personal information, or personally identifiable information under applicable data privacy laws; or (ii) are required to do so by applicable law.&nbsp; The privacy policy or notice and terms that you include as part of your submission may not conflict with this Agreement, which shall take precedence in case of inconsistency or conflict.</li>
  <li>Twitch is not responsible for any product liability claims, failure to meet applicable legal or regulatory requirements, or warranties, whether express or implied by law, covering your Extension and you may not hold out Twitch as such.</li>
  <li>Twitch reserves its right to market your Extension in its sole discretion, including featuring, promoting, or categorizing for discovery purposes, your Extension, or not marketing your Extension at all.</li>
  <li>Your Extension must comply with Twitch’s <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/guidelines-and-policies/">Extensions Guidelines &amp; Policies</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data Collection, Sharing, and Use</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitch will allow you to place Cookies for the purpose of affecting end user preferences, <em>e.g.</em>, format, position, etc., of the Extension. You may not use Cookies to: (a) engage in data science activities or perform analytics on end users and their activity on Twitch, except as expressly allowed by Twitch; or (b) create demographic clusters or end user profiles for the purpose of contacting or targeting end users on or off the Twitch Services.</li>
  <li>When a broadcaster un-installs your Extension, you must respect that command by ceasing to collect information from that broadcaster.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Commercial Activity</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you charge channel owners for access to your Extension or to a feature of your Extension: (a) you are the seller of record for such Extension and you must provide your pricing models, including all relevant charges, taxes, and fees, to broadcasters in a reasonably transparent manner and consistent with applicable laws and regulations prior to any payment or conclusion of a contract; and (b) you are solely responsible for complying with the tax obligations of charging for your Extensions, including, but not limited to, determining whether they are taxable, applying the correct tax rate(s), and collecting and remitting taxes in each relevant jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bits in Extensions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We encourage you to use Bits in Extensions as an opportunity to enrich the viewing experience on the Twitch Services as opposed to simply providing a means for the end user to obtain a digital item or experience. See our policies on content and functionality for Bits in Extensions at <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/">https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/</a>.</li>
  <li>Developers set the amount of Bits necessary for the exchange of permitted digital items and experiences, subject to Twitch’s approval. Twitch reserves its right to offer discounts and promotions, which may include bundled sales of products.</li>
  <li>Twitch reserves the right to return Bits that are used in your Extension to the relevant end user in its sole discretion. Twitch may withhold and/or clawback revenue share associated with such Bits. If you voluntarily take down your Extension, or Twitch takes down your Extension due to violations of applicable law or this Agreement, Twitch may withhold and/or clawback revenue share associated with Bits that are used in your Extension for the previous three (3) months before such take down.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Support</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for customer support requests that are redirected to you by Twitch’s customer support teams. You must respond to customer support requests from end users or Twitch (including Amazon) within twenty-four (24) hours and make reasonable efforts to resolve such requests within five (5) business days of receiving such requests.</li>
  <li>Twitch is not responsible for any support or maintenance of your Extension and you may not hold out Twitch as such. Broadcasters, viewers, and any end users need to know how to reach you with questions and support issues. You must identify a support URL or email address with your Extension details, as well as within your terms, that includes an easy way to reach you.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>License to Twitch</strong></p>

<p>You grant Twitch an unrestricted, worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, modify, and create derivative works of Your Services for the purpose of operating Twitch Extensions (including marketing, branding, and promoting Twitch Extensions or the Twitch Services) in any form, format, media, or media channels now known or later developed or discovered. You may terminate the license you grant Twitch in connection with Your Services, however, Twitch may continue to retain an Extension, and associated content, on its systems for archival purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Take Down and Removal</strong></p>

<p>Twitch reserves the right to remove your Extension from Twitch Extensions, for any reason or no reason at all, at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>

<p>Without limiting the generality of the body of this Agreement, Twitch may collect, analyze, use, and share data on the use of your Extension by broadcasters and end users.</p>

<p><strong>Revenue Share, Payment Terms, Taxes</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Revenue Share. If you enable your Extension for Bits in Extensions, for each eligible use of Bits in the Extension, you will receive a fee (a “Bits Fee”) that will be equal to twenty percent (20%) of one (1) U.S. cent per Bit.</li>
  <li>Payment Terms. Subject to the terms of this paragraph, we will pay you a Bits Fee approximately forty-five (45) days after the end of the calendar month in which the applicable use of the Bits was made. All payments will be made via check, Electronic Funds Transfer (“EFT”), or other methods we choose and in the currency we choose. We are entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amounts due to you (net of any tax withholding or deduction, as further described below) exceed our minimum payment thresholds defined below. Depending on the country where you are located, we may require you to provide us with information for a valid bank account in your name for receiving EFT payments and, if you do not provide that information, we may withhold payments, without interest, until you do so and/or pay you via check and deduct a payment processing fee. Your receipt of a Bits Fee is also contingent on you providing Twitch all other information and documentation necessary and appropriate to effectuate payment. If you do not provide such information and documentation within 180 days following any Bits Fee becoming payable to you by Twitch, you will forfeit such Bits Fees on a month-to-month rolling basis until such information and documentation is received by Twitch. You may not maintain any action or proceeding against us with respect to any report or payment unless you commence that action or suit within six (6) months after the date the report or payment was due.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Offsets / Withholding. If we pay you a Bits Fee and later issue a return or refund of Bits to the end user, we may offset the amount of the Bits Fee we previously paid you against future Bits Fees or other amounts that would otherwise be payable to you under this Agreement, or require you to remit that amount to us. We may also withhold and offset any sums you owe to us against amounts that are payable to you. When this Agreement terminates, we may withhold all Bits Fees due for a period of three (3) months from the date they would otherwise be payable, in order to ensure our ability to offset any end user returns or refunds or other offsets to which we are entitled.</li>
  <li>Violations. If a third party asserts that you did not have all rights required to make available a digital item or experience, if we determine that you may be in breach of this Agreement, or if we have other claims against you, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to us, we reserve the right to withhold (and you agree you will not be eligible to receive) Bits Fees otherwise payable to you under this Agreement, whether or not directly related to such violation, pending resolution of such issues.</li>
  <li>Payment Threshold. Twitch will not be obligated to make a payment if the total amount to be paid to you in connection with Bits in Extensions under this Agreement is less than one-hundred dollars ($100) (the “Payment Threshold”), and may instead accrue such payment obligation until such time as its overall obligation to you is at least the Payment Threshold. If any excess payment has been made to you for any reason whatsoever, we reserve the right to adjust or offset the same against any subsequent fees payable to you under this Agreement.</li>
  <li>Taxes. You are responsible for any income or other taxes due and payable resulting from any Twitch entity’s payments to you. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, the amounts due to you hereunder are inclusive of any taxes that may apply to such payments. Twitch maintains the right, however, to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes that we may be legally obligated to deduct or withhold from amounts due from Twitch, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment to you. If you fulfill any of your digital items or experiences to end users, and if any relevant taxing authority considers those digital items or experiences to be taxable and your fulfillment of those digital items or experiences to be a sale to us that is subject to any sales, use, value added or similar taxes (“Fulfillment Transaction Taxes”), Twitch may provide you with an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority, in which case you will not charge or collect the Fulfillment Transaction Taxes covered by such certificate. You will be solely liable for, and will indemnify and hold us and our affiliates harmless against, all Fulfillment Transaction Taxes, if any, and against all interest, penalties, costs, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) related to any such Fulfillment Transaction Taxes. If any taxing authority assesses or claims any tax liability on or against us or our affiliates with respect to any Fulfillment Transaction Taxes, we or our affiliates will control the defense against such assessment or claim (without limiting your obligation to indemnify and hold us and our affiliates harmless pursuant to this Section). You will provide Twitch with any forms, documents, or other certifications as may be requested by Twitch to satisfy any information reporting or tax obligations with respect to this Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<p>g. Exclusive Program: You will not enter into any program similar to the Drops Program with a third-party streaming platform for 90 days before or after initial distribution of a Drop through the Drops Program. The foregoing restriction does not apply to your own programs or any programs that existed as of the date you entered into this Schedule.</p>

Include a mechanism for broadcasters to disable or enable, during broadcasts of Participating Games or Participating Events, Drops for Linked Users that are viewing that channel (“Broadcaster Setting”).&nbsp; Enabling the Broadcaster Setting shall not result in a charge to broadcasters or in any way reduce their advertising commissions for participating in the Drops program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>d. Provide Aggregate Data and Linked User Data to you in the format and manner chosen by Twitch for each Participating Game or Participating Event for which you have developed and distributed Drops in compliance with Your obligations as set forth in Section II(A)(1).</p>

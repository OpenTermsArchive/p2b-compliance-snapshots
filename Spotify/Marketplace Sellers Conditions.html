While we work hard to ensure the accuracy of the data, we do not guarantee that the Service or the data we collect from the Service will be available error-free or that mistakes, including mistakes in the data insights that we provide to you, will not happen from time to time. Where there is a glitch or mistake in the Service, we will take all reasonable efforts to address or correct these mistakes.

<p>Although Spotify takes reasonable precautions to preserve and protect the Content stored in the database used by Spotify to provide the Service, you shall not rely on the Service as your only storage facility, and you should preserve backup copies of your User Content. Spotify is not liable for damage to, deletion of, or failure to store any Content.</p>
<h2><a id="beta-features" href="#beta-features"></a>Beta Features</h2>

<h2><a id="governing-law-mandatory-arbitration-and-venue" href="#governing-law-mandatory-arbitration-and-venue"></a>Governing Law, Mandatory Arbitration and Venue</h2>
<p><u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</u></p>
<p>These Terms (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with these Terms (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising out of or in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement below. Spotify does not accept any codes of conduct as mandatory in connection with the services provided under these Terms.</p>
<p><u>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</u></p>
<p>This arbitration agreement applies only to users in the United States.</p>
<p><u>Dispute resolution and arbitration</u></p>
<p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.</p>
<p><u>Exceptions</u></p>
<p>You and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to bring an individual action (1) in a U.S. small claims court or (2) in a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1.1 above, seeking (a) only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator or (b) public injunctive relief, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p>
<p><u>No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver</u></p>
<p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>
<p><u>Arbitration rules</u></p>
<p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in force ("AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org. Spotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.</p>
<p>Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be determined by the arbitration in accordance with AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules.</p>
<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>
<p><u>Notice;Process</u></p>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by electronic mail to <a href="mailto:legal@spotify.com">legal@spotify.com</a> and by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required) to the address below ("<strong>Notice</strong>"). Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("<strong>Demand</strong>"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you the greater of (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>
<p><u>Enforceability</u></p>
<p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern with respect to any aspect of any dispute, claim or controversy that, as a result of such invalidation, is no longer governed by this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with these Terms (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising out of or in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement below. Spotify does not accept any codes of conduct as mandatory in connection with the services provided under these Terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eARBITRATION AGREEMENT\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis arbitration agreement applies only to users in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eDispute resolution and arbitration\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eExceptions\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to bring an individual action (1) in a U.S. small claims court or (2) in a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1.1 above, seeking (a) only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator or (b) public injunctive relief, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eNo Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eArbitration rules\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") then in force (\"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org. Spotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be determined by the arbitration in accordance with AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eNotice;Process\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by electronic mail to \u003ca href=\"mailto:legal@spotify.com\"\u003elegal@spotify.com\u003c/a\u003e and by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required) to the address below (\"\u003cstrong\u003eNotice\u003c/strong\u003e\"). Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"\u003cstrong\u003eDemand\u003c/strong\u003e\"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you the greater of (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eEnforceability\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern with respect to any aspect of any dispute, claim or controversy that, as a result of such invalidation, is no longer governed by this Arbitration Agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003ca href=\"#about-these-terms\" id=\"about-these-terms\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAbout These Terms\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract.

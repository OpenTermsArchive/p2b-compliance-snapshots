Royalties for certain In-App Products are subject to additional restrictions in the In-App Products Schedule. Taxes and any separately stated fees or charges are excluded from the List Price and Retail Price when calculating Royalties. A Royalty is due only for sales for which we have received final payment from or on behalf of an end user. If an App is purchased using a credit card or bank account deduction mechanism, final payment will be deemed to have occurred when the applicable credit card company or bank has fully settled the payment for the applicable purchase. The List Price or Retail Price used for purposes of calculating Royalties for PC Games and PC Software will be based on our determination of an end user&#39;s country.</p></li><li><strong>Territory</strong>. Worldwide, subject to Section 3d of this Schedule.</li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Submission of Apps</strong>. You may choose to submit to us any Apps that meet the requirements of the Agreement. While an App is available for distribution, you will submit any bug fixes, patches, and other updates to the Apps, together with any related Product Information, as soon as they are available. You will ensure that all of your Content complies with this Agreement and the applicable Program Policies. For any Content that requires a license key or other data element that an end user must use in order to use or access any feature of functionality of an App (a &quot;<strong>License Key</strong>&quot;), you will deliver License Keys to us upon request in a format we specify.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grants of Rights</strong></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" type="a"><li><p><strong>Distribution.</strong> You hereby grant us the nonexclusive, irrevocable (subject to Sections 6 and 7 of this Schedule), royalty-free right to sell, distribute, and make available your Apps through the Program to end users in the Territory by all means of electronic distribution available now or in the future. You also hereby grant us the nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide rights to (i) use, evaluate and test your Content; (ii) reproduce and store your Apps in digital form on one or more computer facilities for the purpose of promoting, selling and distributing the Apps and in connection with the Program; (iii) modify and add to your Apps so that we can collect analytics relating to the Apps, evaluate and enforce our Program Policies, and share aggregated information with you and others regarding the Program; (iv) modify and add to your Mobile Apps so we can (at your option) enforce digital rights management (&quot;<strong>DRM</strong>&quot;); (v) add metadata to your Mobile Apps so we can improve their compatibility with Amazon devices; and (vi) retain, after the Term, one or more electronic copies of each App and associated Content and allow access to and downloads and re-downloads of Apps by end users as provided in this Agreement. For Alexa Skills, the distribution rights set forth in the Alexa Skills Schedule apply in lieu of the rights set forth in this Section 3a. You acknowledge that we may allow end users who have purchased an App to download unlimited copies of that App. For avoidance of doubt, if end users download or access an App that is free of charge, that App will be deemed to be &quot;purchased&quot; by the end user for purposes of this Agreement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Promotion.</strong> You hereby grant us the nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide rights to use, reproduce, distribute, reformat, modify, create excerpts from, promote, advertise, transmit, and publicly display and perform in any and all digital and other formats (i) the Product Information for promotional purposes in connection with the Program (except that we will not use any trademarks you provide for purposes of us selling an App after the withdrawal of that App as described in Section 6 of this Schedule or after the Term) and (ii) your Apps and other Content in order to create limited promotional excerpts and in order to allow end users to try your Apps for a limited time without downloading or installing them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Additional Rights.</strong> In addition, we may exercise any ancillary rights relating to your Content that are reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the grants of rights contained in this Agreement, such as the rights to encode and to publicly perform. We may also sublicense our rights in Product Information under this Agreement to third parties operating the websites or online or mobile points of presence described in Section 1a of this Schedule. Nothing in this Agreement restricts us from exercising any right available to us under applicable law or any separate license.</p></li><li><p><strong>Geographic Filtering</strong>. Through our developer portal, you may designate countries where you do not want us to sell your Apps. We will implement measures intended to identify an end user&#39;s country and to not offer your Apps for sale to end users from any countries you designate. We may rely on our determination of an end user&#39;s country for all purposes under this Agreement.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Additional Distribution Terms</strong></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" type="a"><li><p><strong>EULA</strong>. You may provide an end user license agreement (&quot;<strong>Developer&#39;s EULA</strong>&quot;) with any App if it complies with the requirements of, and is not inconsistent with, this Agreement. For any Mobile Apps you submit to the Program, you agree that the provisions of our customer terms of use for the Amazon Appstore that we designate as default end user license terms (<strong>&quot;Default EULA Terms&quot;</strong>) will apply to end users&#39; use of your Mobile Apps and associated Content. The Default EULA Terms will specify, among other things, that you are the licensor of the Mobile Apps and that we are not parties to your EULA. If there are any conflicts between the Default EULA Terms and Developer&#39;s EULA, then to the extent of such conflict the Default EULA Terms will control. We do not have any responsibility or liability related to compliance or non-compliance by you or any end user under a Developer&#39;s EULA or the Default EULA Terms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Embedded Advertising</strong>. You will ensure that any advertising presented to end users of the Content complies with all requirements of this Agreement. For example, (i) your access to and use of information related to end users&#39; use of embedded advertising must comply with our privacy-related requirements; (ii) embedded advertising must comply with the applicable Program Policies at the time such advertising is accessed by any end user; and (iii) embedded advertising must not contain any &quot;spyware&quot;, &quot;malware&quot; or harmful code and must not cause injury to any person or damage to any property. In addition, for Mobile Apps, you may not display advertising, marketing, or promotional messaging to end users through the device notification bar or any other device-level notification system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prohibited Actions</strong>. You will not submit any Content that contains any software or other materials that are subject to licenses or restrictions (e.g., open source software licenses) that, when combined with additional software or other materials (collectively <strong>&quot;additional items&quot;</strong>), would require us to disclose, license, distribute or otherwise make all or any part of such additional items available to anyone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support.</strong> You will provide reasonable technical and product support for your Content as requested by end users or us or as described in our Program Policies. Your technical support will include levels of availability, response times and technical skills that are at least equivalent to those for the support you provide to end users of Similar Services. Without limiting the previous sentence, at a minimum you will respond within 24 hours to any support request that we identify as critical, and in all other cases within five business days of request from an end user or us. A &quot;<strong>Similar Service&quot;</strong> is any online service that makes any digital products or services similar to those sold, distributed or promoted through the Program available to end users using a mode of sale or distribution similar to those used by the Program, including any mobile or Internet-based application marketing, sales, and distribution service.</p></li><li><p><strong>For Mobile Apps Only &ndash; Content Policy</strong>. You and your Content must comply with the Appstore Content Policy, located at <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/policy-center/understanding-content-policy.html">https://developer.amazon.com/docs/policy-center/understanding-content-policy.html</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>For Mobile Apps Only &ndash; Family Library</strong>. Our Family Library feature allows end users to link their Amazon accounts together to create a shared library of digital content for their household. Each member of a Family Library may download and use Mobile Apps purchased by the other members of that Family Library, and references in this Agreement to the end user who purchased an App will also include the members of that end user&#39;s Family Library.</p></li><li><p><strong>For Mobile Apps Only &ndash; DRM; Usage Policy</strong>. For your Mobile Apps, you may choose whether to enforce our DRM. If you decide not to enforce DRM for a Mobile App, that means our systems will not restrict end users who have purchased the Mobile App from downloading and/or making unlimited copies of the Mobile App. If you decide to enforce DRM for a Mobile App, that means you will allow end users who have purchased the Mobile App to download unlimited free copies of the Mobile App only to devices that are authenticated to their Amazon customer accounts. You will not incorporate any digital rights management technologies into Mobile Apps, other than any digital rights management technologies that only restrict end users&#39; access to media content distributed through a Mobile App (and not access to, or use of, the Mobile App itself).</p></li><li><p><strong>App Testing Service</strong>. We may provide you access to services (&quot;<strong>App Testing Services</strong>&quot;) that allow you to invite end users you designate (&quot;<strong>Testers</strong>&quot;) to download or enable an App (such as a Mobile App or an Alexa Skill), or a version of an App, before you make it available to the general public (a &quot;<strong>Test App</strong>&quot;). Testers will not be charged, and we will not pay you a Royalty, for the purchase of Test Apps or any In-App Products made available in Test Apps. If, after distributing a Test App through an App Testing Service, you make a version of that Test App available to the general public (including through any Similar Service), (i) you will submit that App for distribution through the Program and (ii) we may give to each Tester, without charge and without paying you a Royalty, that App and any In-App Products the Tester purchased in the Test App (or alternate In-App Products of equal or lesser value). You are responsible for selecting all Testers and ensuring you have obtained any consents necessary to share the Testers&#39; contact information with us and for us to invite the Testers to participate in an App Testing Service.</p></li><li><p><strong>For PC Software Only - Marketing Development Funds/Coop.</strong> For your PC Software, if you or any of your affiliates are, from time to time, a party to any agreement with Amazon pursuant to which you (or your affiliate) has agreed to pay marketing development funds, coop, rebates, or similar payments (collectively, &quot;<strong>MDF</strong>&quot;) for the physical version of any PC Software, then you will also pay equivalent MDF to us for the PC Software distributed under this Agreement. We may offset against payments due to you the amount of any MDF payable to us from you.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;List Price; Retail Price; Royalty Payments and Reporting; Taxes&nbsp;</strong></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" type="a"><li><p><strong>List Price</strong>. The <strong>&quot;List Price&quot;</strong> for an App is the list price you provide for that App for the applicable Amazon Marketplace (for Mobile Apps or Alexa Skills) or country (for PC Games and PC Software). If you do not provide us a List Price for an App in all currencies in which we make that App available for sale, we may generate List Prices for any currencies you have not provided based on a List Price you have provided for that App, and we may update any List Prices we generate from time to time as currency conversion rates change. List Prices are inclusive of any VAT or similar taxes included in the purchase price displayed to end users, but those taxes are excluded from the List Price for Royalty calculation purposes. For example, if the List Price for your App for an Amazon Marketplace is 1.15 Euro and we display prices to an end user of that Amazon Marketplace inclusive of 15% VAT, the List Price for Royalty calculation purposes for a sale to that end user is 1.00 Euro.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retail Price</strong>. The &quot;Retail Price&quot; for an App is the actual price charged to an end user of an App minus any Taxes and any separately stated fees or charges. We have sole discretion to set the Retail Price and other terms on which we sell Apps.</p></li><li><p><strong>Payment Terms</strong>. Subject to the terms of this paragraph, we will pay you Royalties (i) for Mobile Apps (including Mobile App In-App Products) and Alexa Skills (including In-Skill Products), approximately 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which the applicable sale is made and (ii) for PC Games and PC Software (including PC Game and PC Software In-App Products), approximately 45 days after the end of the calendar month in which the applicable sale is made. At the time of payment, we will make available to you a report detailing sales of Apps and corresponding Royalties. All payments will be made via check, Electronic Funds Transfer (&quot;<strong>EFT</strong>&quot;) or other methods we designate in the Program Policies, in the currency in which the Apps were sold or other payment currency as set forth in the Program Policies. If we pay you for a sale in a currency other than the currency in which the sale was made, we will convert the Royalties from the currency in which the sale was made to the payment currency at an exchange rate that we or our bank determine, which may include fees and charges for the conversion. We are entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amounts due to you (net of any tax withholding or deduction, as further described below) exceed the minimum payment thresholds set forth in the Program Policies. Depending on the country where you are located, we may require you to provide us with information for a valid bank account in your name for receiving EFT payments and, if you do not provide that information, we may withhold payments, without interest, until you do so and/or pay you via check and deduct a payment processing fee. You may not maintain any action or proceeding against us with respect to any report or payment unless you commence that action or suit within 6 months after the date the report or payment was due. If we pay you a Royalty on a sale and later issue a refund or credit to the end user for such sale (or receive a chargeback related to the sale), we may offset the amount of the Royalty we previously paid you against future Royalties or other amounts that would otherwise be payable to you under this Agreement, or require you to remit that amount to us. We may also withhold and offset any sums you owe to us against amounts that are payable to you. If a third party asserts that you did not have all rights required to make available an App to us, if we determine that you may be in breach of this Agreement, or if we have other claims against you, we are entitled to hold all Royalties pending resolution of such issue. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or if you are unable to demonstrate that you have all necessary rights to the Content you provide us, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold Royalties to you. If after we have terminated your Program account you open a new Program account without our express permission, we will not owe you any Royalties under the new Program account. When this Agreement terminates, we may withhold all Royalties due for a period of three months from the date they would otherwise be payable, in order to ensure our ability to offset any end user refunds or other offsets to which we are entitled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Taxes</strong>. Any Amazon Party selling Apps is responsible for collecting and remitting any taxes imposed on its sales of those Apps to end users. You are responsible for any income or other taxes due and payable resulting from any Amazon Party&#39;s payments to you. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, the amounts due to you hereunder are inclusive of any taxes that may apply to such payments. The Amazon Parties maintain the right, however, to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes that we may be legally obligated to deduct or withhold from amounts due from the Amazon Parties, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment to you. If you fulfill any of your Content to end users, and if any relevant taxing authority considers that Content to be taxable and your fulfillment of that Content to be a sale to us that is subject to any sales, use, value added or similar taxes (&quot;<strong>Fulfillment Transaction Taxes</strong>&quot;), Amazon may provide you with an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority, in which case you will not charge or collect the Fulfillment Transaction Taxes covered by such certificate. You will be solely liable for, and will indemnify and hold us and our affiliates harmless against, all Fulfillment Transaction Taxes, if any, and against all interest, penalties, costs and expenses (including attorney&#39;s fees) related to any such Fulfillment Transaction Taxes.

Fees will be calculated by us in our sole reasonable discretion. You will pay us the applicable Fees for use of the Moments Service using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Schedule will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments. We may also withhold and offset any sums you owe to us against amounts that are payable to you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Taxes</strong>. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Schedule. All fees payable by Developer are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including, without limitation, VAT, excise taxes, sales and transaction taxes, and gross receipts taxes (&quot;<strong>Indirect Taxes</strong>&quot;). Developer will provide such information to Amazon as reasonably required to determine whether Amazon is obligated to collect Indirect Taxes from Developer. Amazon will not collect, and Developer will not pay, any such Indirect Tax or duty for which Developer furnishes Amazon a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate or for which Amazon may claim an available exemption from Indirect Tax. All payments made by Developer to Amazon under this Schedule will be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for taxes. If any such taxes (for example, international withholding taxes) are required to be withheld on any payment, Developer will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by Amazon is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Schedule. Amazon will provide Developer with such tax forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Schedule.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rewards and Reward Codes</strong>. You may use the Moments Service to offer end users of your Apps free or discounted products available from Amazon or other sites we may make available (&quot;<strong>Rewards</strong>&quot;) when end users of your Apps take a particular Action. For each such Action that an end user takes, we will provide you a URL, discount code, credit, or other means to allow the end user to access the Reward (collectively, &quot;<strong>Reward Codes</strong>&quot;). The following requirements apply to any Reward Codes we make available to you. You may not re-sell Reward Codes. You will only use the Reward Codes in connection with the Moments Campaign for which they were provided. You will keep the Reward Codes secure and ensure only your employees or agents who are involved in the implementation of the Moments Campaign will have access to the Reward Codes. You will not alter the Reward Codes or create any additional Reward Codes. You will destroy all undistributed Reward Codes within two days after the earlier of the redemption deadline specified in the Moments Campaign or the termination of this Schedule. You will distribute the Reward Codes solely to residents of the countries or territories that we specify are eligible for such Reward Codes. Unless we otherwise approve in writing, each person may only be given one unique Reward Code and no Reward Codes may be used or distributed more than once. Your communication to end users with the Reward Codes must contain: the retail dollar value of the Reward Code, the process for redeeming the Reward, and the terms and conditions of your Moments Campaign. You will comply with any restrictions we specify on the means of distributing the Reward Codes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compliance Requirements</strong>. Without limiting your obligations under the Agreement, you are responsible for operating any Moments Campaigns, using the Moments Service, and carrying out any other activities in connection with the Moments Service in compliance with all applicable Laws. You agree that you are the offeror of all Moments Campaigns and you will provide legally compliant terms and conditions for each Moments Campaign to end users, including any information that Amazon requires you to provide (such as Reward Code expiration dates). If a promoted Reward becomes unavailable prior to the redemption deadline, we may substitute a Reward of equivalent value. You may not distribute, publish, send, or facilitate the sending of unsolicited mass e-mail or other messages, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (like &quot;spam&quot;). You may not use the Moments Service for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise promote or make available Content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing, offensive, or otherwise violates our Program Policies. We reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to investigate any violation of this Schedule or misuse of the Moments Service, or remove, disable access to, or modify any content that violates this Schedule. You will not provide us with any personally identifiable information or personal data of end users of your Apps through the Moments Materials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Survival</strong>.

A DRS Referral Fee is due only for purchases for which we have received final payment from or on behalf of an end user. If a purchase is made using a credit card or bank account deduction mechanism, final payment will be deemed to have occurred when the applicable credit card company or bank has fully settled the payment for the applicable purchase.</p></li><li><p><strong>Payment Terms.</strong> Subject to the terms of this Section 5 of this Schedule, we will pay you DRS Referral Fees approximately 90 days after the end of the calendar month in which the applicable Eligible DRS Purchase is made. Upon your written request, we will make available to you a report summarizing Eligible DRS Purchases made during the 30-day period preceding such request, but you may not make this request more than once in any 30-day period. Unless we agree in our sole discretion to make payment by check (only available in the U.S.), all payments will be made via Electronic Funds Transfer (&quot;<strong>EFT</strong>&quot;), in the currency in which the Eligible DRS Purchases were made or other payment currency as set forth in the DRS Program Requirements or DRS Materials. If we pay you a DRS Referral Fee for a Eligible DRS Purchase in a currency other than the currency in which the purchase was made, we will convert the DRS Referral Fee from the currency in which the purchase was made to the payment currency at an exchange rate that we or our bank determine, which may include fees and charges for the conversion. We are entitled to accrue and withhold payments, without interest, until the total amounts due to you (net of any tax withholding or deduction, as further described below) exceed $100. Depending on the country where you are located, we may require you to provide us with information for a valid bank account in your name for receiving EFT payments and, if you do not provide that information, we may withhold payments, without interest, until you do so and/or pay you via check and deduct a payment processing fee. We will deduct a payment processing fee in the amount of $15 from the DRS Referral Fees payable to you for each check we send to you. You may not maintain any action or proceeding against us with respect to any report or payment unless you commence that action or suit within 6 months after the date the report or payment was due. If we pay you a DRS Referral Fee on a sale and later issue a refund or credit to the end user for such sale (or receive a chargeback related to the sale), we may offset the amount of the DRS Referral Fee we previously paid you against future DRS Referral Fees or other amounts that would otherwise be payable to you under this Agreement, or require you to remit that amount to us. We may also withhold and offset any sums you owe to us against amounts that are payable to you. If we determine that you may be in breach of this Agreement, or if we have other claims against you, we are entitled to hold all DRS Referral Fees pending resolution of such issue. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold DRS Referral Fees from you. If after we have terminated your account you open a new account without our express permission, we will not owe you any DRS Referral Fees under the new account. At the end of the DRS Wind-Down Period, we may withhold all DRS Referral Fees due for a period of three months from the date they would otherwise be payable, in order to ensure our ability to offset any end user refunds or other offsets to which we are entitled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for any income or other taxes due and payable resulting from any Amazon Party&#39;s payments to you.

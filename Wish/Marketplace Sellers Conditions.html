The Beta Programs may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which Wish will provide to you prior to your use of the Beta Programs. Such Beta Programs and all communications or materials (oral or written) relating to Beta Programs will be considered Confidential Information and subject to the confidentiality provisions in these Terms. You agree that you will not make any public statements or disclose your participation in any of the Beta Programs without Wish's prior written consent. Wish makes no representations or warranties regarding the Beta Programs. Wish may change, cancel, or discontinue the Beta Programs at any time, in Wish's sole discretion. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Wish will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with the Beta Programs. </p><h3>Modifications to the Agreement:</h3><p>Because relevant Applicable Laws as well as the business environment, periodically change, Wish reserves the right to amend the Terms and the Additional Terms and Policies at any time, as set forth herein. In that instance, Wish will provide thirty (30) days' advance notice of any such amendment if required by Applicable Laws to do so. The notice will be provided via electronic mail, the Wish Merchant Dashboard, the Wish Application Program Interface ("Wish API"), or other commercially reasonable means. Regarding any such amendment, you agree that the continuation of your use of the Services after receipt of the notice of such amendment shall constitute your acknowledgement and acceptance of any and all such changes, and it shall also constitute adequate consideration to support such change(s), which shall automatically be incorporated into this Agreement as of the effective date stated in the amendment. </p><p>Unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Laws, you agree that any amendment will only apply to Disputes that arise after the effective date of such amendment unless you have expressly agreed to such amendment. </p><p>Prior to the effective date of such proposed amendment, you may opt out of any proposed amendment by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: General Counsel, ContextLogic Inc., One Sansome Street, 33rd Fl., San Francisco, CA 94104, or by email to&nbsp;<a class="root_2ttlm8 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="mailto:merchant_notices@wish.com">merchant_notices@wish.com</a>. Wish reserves the right to cancel, within reason, your account and terminate your access to the Services if you do not agree to any proposed amendment, with proper notice. </p><h3>Password and Account Security:</h3><p>You are required to keep your account (including any sub-account) and password secure and are responsible for all activity, liability, and damage resulting from your failure to maintain password confidentiality. You agree to immediately notify Wish of any unauthorized use or access of your password or your account or any other breach of security of your account. You also agree that Wish cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your account secure or any unauthorized access of or other breach of security of your account. You agree not to share your login credentials with any third parties. You agree not to use the same login credentials for your account that you use for any other platform. </p><p>Wish strongly encourages the use of two factor authentication to add an additional layer of security. </p><h3>Account Information:</h3><p>You must keep your account information up to date and accurate at all times, including a valid name, address, phone number, email address, and bank account information. To sell Products on the Services you must provide and maintain valid payment information. You authorize us (and will provide us documentation evidencing your authorization upon our request) to verify your information (including any updated information), to obtain credit reports about you from time to time, to obtain credit authorizations from the issuer of your credit card, and, in limited circumstances, to charge your credit card or debit your bank account for any sums payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise). You also agree to provide Wish any additional information, documents (including identity documents), or authorizations as may be necessary for Wish to provide the Services or for you to fulfill your obligations under this Agreement. </p><h3>Account Transfer:</h3><p>You may not transfer or sell your account, username, or associated payment provider or processor account to another party nor may you register multiple merchant accounts at any time. If you are registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement. Failure to abide by this section shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement and may result in your accounts being removed from the platform. </p><h3>Right to Refuse Service:</h3><p>Wish reserves the right to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts, to refuse to offer and restrict, suspend, or disable any part of the Services to you, issue penalties, to cancel orders, remove your listings, and delete all data or other information associated with your account (including any materials you may have submitted to us), among other remedies or actions we may take pursuant to this Agreement or Applicable Laws, for any violation or suspected violation of this Agreement or Applicable Laws, with or without notice to you. We may also discontinue the Services or any part of the Services and delete all data or other information associated with your account (including any materials you may submit to us). We assume no liability for any information removed from the Services, and we reserve the right to permanently restrict your access to the Services or your account. You agree that you do not have any rights in the Services and that we have no liability to you if the Services are discontinued or if you are no longer able to access the Services or any information that was previously made available to you on the Services. </p><h3>Closing Your Account:</h3><p>You may choose to close your account&nbsp;by contacting merchant_notices@wish.com. We will notify you when your account has been closed. If we are unable to close your account, you will receive an email detailing why your account cannot be closed and any additional steps or information that may be required from you before closing your account. The closure of your account does not extinguish any of your obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of any amounts due to Wish, nor does it preclude Wish from pursuing any remedy against you for any violation or suspected violation of this Agreement or any Applicable Laws. </p><h2>3. Fees and Payment</h2><h3>Fees:</h3><p>Wish will collect, earn or receive commissions, fees, payments or other amounts from you, for your use of or access to the Services and or when you sell a Product using the Services as set forth in the&nbsp;<a class="root_2ttlm8 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="/policy/fees_and_payments">Fees and Payments Policy</a>&nbsp;or as otherwise communicated to you by Wish. Wish may charge listing fees (the "Listing Fees") related to the offering and sale of certain products or services, including but not limited to, the number of products available in your product catalog. Such fees may be assessed on a per item basis or after a merchant has reached a limit (as determined by Wish) on the number of items being offered for sale on the platform. Moreover, the amount of fees and/or item limits may differ between tiers of merchants as determined by Wish in its sole discretion. If any fees are assessed, they will be collected according to a schedule and we will notify all Merchants of such schedule in accordance with this Agreement. If Wish charges Listing Fees for excessive product listings, we will notify all Merchants of the time period for determining such Listing Fees in accordance with this Agreement. Additional Wish products and services (e.g., ProductBoost) may be subject to additional or different terms and fees. We reserve the right to change the commission or fees charged from time to time and will notify you in advance of such changes; however, no advance notice is required for temporary promotions or changes that result in the reduction of commissions or fees. </p><h3>Payment:</h3><p>Wish will make payments to you of the amount that we collect from the sale of your Products, less any commission earned, fees charged, and other amounts owed in connection with all aspects of your use of the Services, as set forth in the <a class="root_2ttlm8 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="/policy/fees_and_payments">Fees and Payments Policy</a>, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or as otherwise communicated to you by Wish. </p><p>Wish will pay all amounts owed to you to the payment provider or processor you have designated by means specified by us. Any amount due to you under this Agreement shall be considered made and complete, and any payment obligation extinguished, upon remittance to such payment provider or processor. Each payment provider or processor may have its own terms of use or other legal requirements which you are subject to. Wish is not responsible for any services provided by or fees owed to any such payment provider or processor (including, any remittance of payment, security protocols or obligations to the merchant, accurate and timely disbursal of payments to the merchant, or unavailability of such third party services). The risk of loss and nonpayment from the payment provider or processor remains solely with you. </p><p>For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (a) charge your account or any payment instrument you provide to us; (b) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement, converting balances in your account to Wish, or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (c) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (d) reverse any credits to you; or (e) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. In addition, Wish may in its sole discretion elect to withhold any amounts payable to you under this Agreement, until such time as Wish receives valid confirmation of Product delivery. Transactions for which Wish cannot confirm valid delivery may be ineligible for payment and may subject your account balance to temporary or permanent holds or account suspension. </p><p>Furthermore, even if the product has been delivered, if Wish determines that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations, or suspected violations of this Agreement, or other risks to Wish or third parties, or reflect pending or otherwise unrecoupable balances, then Wish may, in its sole discretion, withhold, delay, or offset any payments to be made or are otherwise due to you for as long as Wish determines such conditions or any related risks to Wish or third parties persist. </p><p>If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or other illegal activity, or to violate this Agreement, then we may permanently withhold, or offset and retain any payments that otherwise may have been payable to you in our sole discretion. In addition, we may require that you pay other amounts to secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement or to mitigate the risk of returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations, or suspected violations of this Agreement, or other risks to Wish or third parties. These amounts may be refundable or nonrefundable in the manner we determine, which may include converting balances in your account to Wish, and failure to comply with this Agreement may result in their forfeiture. </p><h2>4. Appointment of Wish as Limited Payment Collection Agent</h2><p>You hereby appoint Wish as your payment collection agent, solely for the limited purpose of accepting funds from users who purchase Products through the Services. </p><p>You agree that any funds resulting from a user's purchase of any product or service through the Services and received by Wish from a user shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to you by a user. You further agree that you will provide the purchased Products to the user in the agreed-upon manner as if you have received the payment directly from the user. You agree that Wish may refund the user in accordance with Wish's&nbsp;<a class="root_2ttlm8 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wish.com/return_policy">Return Policy</a>. As stated above, you understand and agree that Wish's obligation to pay you is subject to and conditioned upon successful receipt of the associated funds from users who purchase items through the Services. Wish guarantees payments to you only for such amounts that have been successfully received by Wish from users in accordance with this Agreement and Wish's&nbsp;<a class="root_2ttlm8 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wish.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and that are not subject to refunds made to users. In accepting appointment as your limited payment collection agent, Wish assumes no liability for any of your acts or omissions (including any violation by you of this Agreement or any Applicable Laws). </p><p>You agree that any obligation of a user to pay you for the purchase of any Products through the Services is extinguished upon the user's payment of the funds to Wish, upon which Wish then is responsible for remitting the funds to you in the manner described in this Agreement, the&nbsp;<a class="root_2ttlm8 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="/policy/fees_and_payments">Fees and Payments</a>&nbsp;Policy, or as otherwise communicated by Wish to you. Your funds are not eligible for payment to you unless and until all terms in this Agreement, the&nbsp;<a class="root_2ttlm8 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="/policy/fees_and_payments">Fees and Payments</a>&nbsp;Policy, and Wish's&nbsp;<a class="root_2ttlm8 " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wish.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;are satisfied. In the event that Wish does not remit any such payment or funds to you, you will have recourse only against Wish and not the user directly. </p><p>You agree that Wish may honor any governmental or judicial order attaching, garnishing, or levying upon funds otherwise payable to you hereunder and that any payment to a governmental authority or a third party pursuant to a court order by Wish as required by such order shall relieve Wish of any obligation to pay such funds to you. </p><p>You further agree that Wish shall have no obligation to invest such funds for your account and that you shall not be entitled to any interest earned on such funds while such funds are in the possession of Wish. </p><p>Wish shall have the right to offset its obligation to pay you such funds to satisfy any obligation then owing by you to Wish. Wish shall otherwise have no interest in the funds that it holds for you as paying agent, and any liability for taxation or otherwise related to such funds shall be entirely yours. </p><p>Wish will disburse funds owed hereunder to you upon your written instruction and shall have the right to rely on such written instruction. Under no circumstance shall Wish be obligated to advance to you funds it does not hold as your paying agent. </p><p>Wish reserves the right to resign as your paying agent and cancel your account at any time. </p><h2>5.

MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h3><p>Our merchant support team is ready to assist you and address your concerns; email merchant_support@wish.com. </p><p><span class="root_1tk9ap7 ">YOU AND WISH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND WISH SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, subject to the exceptions below.</span> </p><p><span class="root_1tk9ap7 ">YOU AND WISH HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, except as specified herein. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</span> </p><p>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ("ARBITRATION AGREEMENT"). IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE MOST DISPUTES WITH WISH, AND LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM OR ACTION. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WISH WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION OR MAY BE LIMITED. </p><p>YOU AND WISH UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THIS ARBITRATION SECTION OPERATES AS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT IS SEVERABLE FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IS ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF THE ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT. CONSIDERATION FOR THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PARTIES' MUTUAL AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES. </p><p>"Disputes" shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and Wish related in any way to or arising in any way out of or from the Agreement, the Services, the Content, Submissions (public, personal, or limited audience), including, but not limited to, sales, payments, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies (including violations or suspected violations thereof), fulfillment, privacy, advertising, or any communications between you and Wish, even if the claim arises after you or Wish has terminated the Services or a user account. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you bring against our employees, agents, Affiliates, or other representatives; or (b) that Wish brings against you. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Wish, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, warranty, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before the Agreement or out of prior Agreement(s) with Wish; (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation; or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of the Agreement. Except as specifically excluded herein, Dispute/Disputes shall be given the broadest possible meaning permitted by law. </p><p>Notwithstanding this Arbitration Agreement, Disputes concerning patents, copyrights (including claims under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act), trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy shall not be subject to arbitration. </p><p>Notwithstanding this Arbitration Agreement, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to ensure that the relief sought in arbitration is not rendered ineffectual during the pendency of, or after the rendition of, a decision in any arbitration proceeding. The institution of any action shall not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any claim seeking relief other than injunctive or enforcement relief to arbitration. Further, any party seeking to enforce an award of an arbitrator(s) shall submit the award under seal to maintain protections of confidential information, and you and Wish hereby agree and consent to the filing of such a submission, motion, or order under seal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent a party contests the jurisdiction of a state or federal court to preside over claims for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief as described above, the court in which such claim is made shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether such claim is to be decided by the court. </p><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may not issue a "public injunction;" rather, whether any such "public injunction" is appropriate and/or permitted by law, and if so the terms of such public injunctive relief, must be determined only by a federal or state court. If either party is permitted to seek a "public injunction," all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any such prayer or claim for a "public injunction" in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party's claim or prayer for "public injunctive relief." </p><h3>Binding Arbitration Process and Procedure</h3><p>Except as provided herein: any dispute will be resolved only by binding individual arbitration The parties agree to cooperate regarding the enforcement of any arbitration judgment rendered in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, including in connection with the enforcement of such judgment in any country outside the United States as applicable. </p><p>Unless you and Wish agree otherwise, any Dispute shall be subject to and shall be settled exclusively by final, binding arbitration in accordance with and administered by the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") under its rules and procedures, which are available at the ICC website at iccwbo.org. If the ICC is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If there is a conflict between the ICC rules (or the rules of the alternative arbitral forum selected by the parties) and the rules set forth in this Arbitration Agreement, the rules set forth in this Arbitration Agreement will govern. </p><p>Notwithstanding the rules of the ICC, the following will apply to all arbitration actions: </p><ul><li><p>The Arbitration Agreement and the arbitration will be governed by Dutch Laws. </p></li><li><p>The arbitration will be conducted in English (with appropriate translators as may be necessary). </p></li><li><p>The parties agree that time is of the essence. </p></li><li><p>The arbitration will take place in Amsterdam, Netherlands. </p></li><li>The parties will be allotted equal time to present their respective cases, including cross-examinations. </li></ul><p>In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding the rules of the ICC, certain procedures will apply depending on the amount in controversy. For controversies and claims in which the amount in controversy is&nbsp;less than <span class="root_1tk9ap7 ">$1,000,000.00</span> (one million dollars), the following procedures will apply absent mutual agreement of the parties to the contrary: </p><ul><li><p>The arbitration will occur within 180 days from the date on which the arbitrator is appointed and will last no more than five business days. </p></li><li>There will be one arbitrator selected from the panel provided by the ICC, using the ICC rules for arbitrator selection. </li></ul><p>For controversies and claims in which the amount in controversy is&nbsp;equal to or exceeds <span class="root_1tk9ap7 ">$1,000,000.00</span>,&nbsp;the following procedures will apply absent mutual agreement of the parties to the contrary: </p><ul><li>There will be three arbitrators selected from the panel provided by the ICC, using the ICC rules for arbitrator selection. </li></ul><p>If Wish's or your claim is solely for&nbsp;monetary relief of <span class="root_1tk9ap7 ">$</span>10,000 or less&nbsp;and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the ICC rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator. </p><p>You or Wish may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court with jurisdiction and venue over you if Wish otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to provide Wish with advance notice by email to&nbsp;<a href="">merchant_support@wish.com</a>&nbsp;and by U.S. Mail to General Counsel, ContextLogic Inc., One Sansome Street, 40th Fl, San Francisco, CA 94104. </p><p>To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Wish will pay the additional cost. Wish shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless Wish is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. </p><p>This Agreement, including this Arbitration Agreement, do not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Wish on your behalf. </p><p>The parties agree and understand that maintaining confidentiality of disputes and dispute resolution is of the utmost importance and agree that Wish has valuable trade secrets and proprietary and confidential information. Thus, to the fullest extent allowed by law, the parties agree to take all necessary steps to protect from public disclosure such trade secrets and proprietary and confidential information. </p><h3>Authority of Arbitrator</h3><p>Except as expressly provided herein, the arbitrator(s), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including a claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable , except that the arbitrator(s) shall not have the authority to determine whether the arbitration can proceed on behalf of or against a class. </p><p>The arbitrator(s) shall have no authority to award punitive damages, and the parties waive any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any Dispute resolved by arbitration, except where an applicable statute or other law allows for punitive damages. </p><p>The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable laws, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). </p><p>The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. </p><h3>Special Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration:</h3><p>If 25 or more similar claims (or Disputes) are asserted against Wish by the same or coordinated counsel or otherwise present substantially similar or overlapping allegations of fact or law, the parties agree to the following bellwether procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, a court of competent jurisdiction, and not JAMS or an arbitrator, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute over whether these bellwether procedures apply to any group of claims. </p><p>The parties recognize and agree that a large number of arbitration cases with similar allegations will impose excessive transaction costs regardless of the cases' merit or lack of merit. The parties also recognize and agree that it is logistically difficult or impossible to arbitrate simultaneously large numbers of substantially similar cases. The parties therefore agree to use bellwether litigation procedures similar to those that courts use in mass-tort cases, based on the judiciary's experience that, after one or a few cases are tried to verdict, most or all of the other cases settle or otherwise resolve themselves. </p><p>Thus, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the parties agree that no more than 10 cases will be active at any one time. All remaining cases will be stayed, with the statute of limitations tolled. As soon as one of the original active cases is resolved (by decision, settlement, or otherwise), a stayed arbitration shall replace it on the list of 10 active cases. Except as provided below, cases shall be placed on or moved to the active list in the order demands for arbitration are first received. Until a case is on or is moved to the list of 10 active cases, the sum any party paid to initiate a case shall be refunded, and no arty shall have any obligation to pay any JAMS or arbitrator fees. </p><p>If you claim exceptional hardship from any delay pursuant to this bellwether procedure, you may petition Wish to waive the 10-case limit for that case. If Wish does not agree, you may petition JAMS to place the case on the list of 10 active cases, on the ground that delay will impose exceptional hardship. If JAMS finds exceptional hardship and grants the petition, JAMS shall (based on its determination of relative hardship) remove one other case from the list of 10 active cases and place it at the head of the list of stayed cases. Under no circumstances shall JAMS place more than 10 cases into active status. If more than 10 hardship applications are granted, JAMS shall determine which 10 cases shall proceed first, based on its determination of relative hardship. </p><h3>30-Day Right to Opt Out</h3><p>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: General Counsel, Contextlogic Inc., One Sansome Street, 33rd Fl, San Francisco, CA 94104, or by email to merchant_notices@wish.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your User ID (if any), Merchant ID, the email address you used to set up your account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you and Wish reserves the right to terminate the entirety of the Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us or may enter into in the future with us. </p><h3>Parents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates</h3><p>This Arbitration Agreement will also apply to any Disputes asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of Wish, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of Wish, and to any Disputes asserted by any of them against you. </p><h3>Changes to This Arbitration Section</h3><p>Wish reserves the right to amend the Arbitration Agreement. In that instance, Wish will provide 30 days' advance notice of any such amendment. The notice will be provided via electronic mail, the Wish Merchant Dashboard, the Wish API, or other commercially reasonable means. With regard to any such amendment, you agree that the continuation of your use of the Services, after receipt of the notice of such amendment, shall constitute your acknowledgement and acceptance of any and all such changes, and it shall also constitute adequate consideration to support such change(s), which shall automatically be incorporated into this Arbitration Agreement as of the effective date stated in the amendment. </p><p>Unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Laws, you agree that any amendment will only apply to Disputes that arise after the effective date of such amendment unless you have expressly agreed to such amendment. </p><p>Prior to the effective date of such proposed amendment, you may opt out of any proposed amendment by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: General Counsel, Contextlogic Inc., One Sansome Street, 33rd Fl, San Francisco, CA 94104, or by email to&nbsp;merchant_notices@wish.com. Wish may terminate the Agreement of any merchant who does not agree to a proposed amendment to this Arbitration Agreement. </p><h3>Survival of Arbitration Agreement</h3><p>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or your relationship with Wish. </p><h2>9. WAIVER OF CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS AND ARBITRATIONS:</h2><p><span class="root_1tk9ap7 ">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</span> </p><p><span class="root_1tk9ap7 ">To fullest extent permitted by law, Wish and you agree TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM HEARD AS A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND THE ARBITRATOR(S) SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO PROCEED ON SUCH A BASIS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ASSERTED IN ARBITRATION OR, if permitted under the Agreement, any such proceeding in federal and state court.</span> The parties therefore agree to resolve any Dispute or claim in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Wish and you also therefore agree to not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to any Dispute or claim with a third party. </p><p>The arbitrator or the court cannot combine more than one person's or entity's claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding, unless the parties agree otherwise. </p><p>Furthermore, to the extent any Disputes are not arbitrable as a matter of law, the parties agree that litigation of those disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Disputes in arbitration. </p><p>If any clause within the foregoing class action waivers and individual arbitration agreement are deemed illegal, unenforceable or invalid for any reason, and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), the parties agree that that particular Dispute, claim or request for relief may proceed in court in accordance with Section 22. </p><p>This Section 9 will also apply to any Disputes or claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of Wish, or any employee, officer, director, or investor of Wish, and to any Disputes or claims asserted by any of them against you. </p><p>This Section 9, and the waiver of class and consolidated actions set forth herein, shall survive any termination of your account or the Services. </p><p>Please note that this clause may not be appliable, especially in European Union or the United Kingdom jurisdictions that do not have class or consolidated action options. </p><p>If Wish has posted or provided a translation of the English language version of this Agreement, you agree that the translation is provided for convenience only and that the English language version will govern your uses of the Services. </p></div></div><div><div class="root_dbrs30 "><h2>10.

Customs Duty and Indirect Taxes</h2><p>In an effort to remain compliant with respective consumer legislations, we strongly encourage you to maintain good standing with respect to customs and indirect taxes, where applicable. </p><p>Due to separate and applicable tax jurisdictions, purchases may be subject to specific sales, customs duty, goods and services taxes (GST), or value-added taxes (VAT), and other charges or fees levied by the country of destination. </p><p>According to Applicable Laws, Wish chooses or is required to calculate, collect and remit goods and services taxes (GST) or value-added taxes (VAT).

If you use the Tax ID Number inappropriately in any way, Wish may, in its sole discretion, withhold or offset retaining amounts otherwise due to you, issue a penalty, suspend your account, terminate your account, or take any other actions Wish deems appropriate for so long as Wish in its sole discretion believes that you used the Tax ID Number inappropriately. Inappropriate usage of the Tax ID Number includes, but is not limited to, the following scenarios: </p><ul><li><p>using the Tax ID Number for shipments related to sales carried out outside the Services (e.g., via another online marketplace); </p></li><li><p>transmitting the Tax ID Number to your freight forwarder in an insecure manner; </p></li><li><p>communicating the Tax ID Number to other persons; or </p></li><li>disclosing the Tax ID Number anywhere. </li></ul><p>You agree that you are responsible for remitting indirect tax, custom duties, and other charges or fees levied by the EU or UK for order with the consignment value of the customs set threshold. </p><p>Where Applicable Laws state otherwise and Wish does not choose or is not required to calculate or collect any indirect taxes or custom duties, you may be required to calculate and collect any taxes. We strongly encourage you to consult your own tax experts based on your facts and circumstances. </p><p>In an effort to maintain compliance with U.S. or international tax law, Wish may require you to provide a valid indirect tax registration number or any other document to sell on the Services. </p><h2>19.

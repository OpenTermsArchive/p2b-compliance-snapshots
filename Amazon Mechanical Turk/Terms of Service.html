                    <strong>Amazon Mechanical Turk's Role</strong>. The Site is
                    a venue for Requesters to request and for Workers to perform
                    Tasks. Unless we are participating on the Site as a
                    Requester, we are not involved in the request or the
                    performance of Tasks, and have no control over the quality,
                    safety, or legality of Tasks or consideration for Tasks, the
                    ability of Workers to perform Tasks to Requesters'
                    satisfaction, or the ability of Requesters to pay for Tasks.
                    We are not responsible for the actions of any Requester or
                    Worker, or performing any screening of Requesters or
                    Workers. Because we are not a party to the transactions
                    between Workers and Requesters, we are not responsible for
                    resolving any disputes between Workers and Requesters
                    related to any Tasks or any transaction.

                        than the Site (unless expressly permitted by us in a
                        policy posted on the Site); (iv) payment will be

                        you will be invoiced by AWS for Invoiced Tasks; (v)
                        payment is not refundable; (vi) you will not reject
                        Tasks performed by Workers without good cause; (vii) in
                        addition to payment to Workers, you will be charged fees

                        and remitted to Workers once you approve Tasks; and (ii)
                        if your Prepaid Task Credit is not sufficient to cover
                        payment to Workers and our fees, you will promptly
                        obtain the amount of Prepaid Task Credits necessary to

                        For Invoiced Tasks, Requesters must establish an AWS

                        Tasks; (ii) you will use your human intelligence and

                        your human intelligence or independent judgment to
                        perform Tasks; (iv) you will supply complete and
                        accurate information for all Tasks you perform; (v) you
                        will not perform Tasks through venues other than the
                        Site (unless expressly permitted by us in a policy

                        As a Worker, you agree that: (i) you are responsible for

                        you purchase must be at least equal to the total amount
                        that will be owed to Workers upon completion and

                        credits may not be immediately available for use after
                        purchase. Prepaid Task Credits must be redeemed through

                        Prepaid Tasks performed by Workers and our fees. When
                        purchased, Prepaid Task Credits are credited to a

                        unless already owed to Workers for approved Tasks, may
                        be refunded only to the payment method used to
                        originally purchase the Prepaid Task Credits. Prepaid
                        Task Credits cannot be transferred for value or redeemed

Taxes, you must provide us with evidence of your exemption, which

<li>POS Equipment is purchased, and not leased. Purchase of the POS
Equipment is subject to the POS Equipment Agreement, <a href="&#x2F;legal">POS Equipment
Agreement and Return Policy</a>, applicable to your country.
Upon payment by you for the POS Equipment, and confirmation to you of
shipment of the POS equipment, you will acquire ownership of and title to the hardware
components of the POS Equipment, and you will be licensed to access
and use all POS Software installed in the POS Equipment (and any

for the Chip &amp; Swipe Reader, Swipe (Audio Jack) and physical gift
cards purchased from the Shopify Hardware Store.</li>
<li>The Fees for POS Services will be determined based on the number of
locations at which you are using the POS Services. Locations are
defined by business address and are used for associating orders
with a specific business address. Locations are added through the

Acceptable Use Policy, and Privacy Policy), the following terms
apply to your access and use of the Email Services:</p><ol>
<li>Shopify employs certain controls to scan the content of emails you

Shopify the right to employ such Content Scanning. Shopify does not

Shopify merchant is responsible for all content generated by their
respective Stores.</li>
<li>BY GENERATING OR SENDING EMAIL THROUGH THE EMAIL SERVICES, YOU
AGREE TO COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS (THE “<strong>EMAIL

recipient has not explicitly granted permission to receive emails
from you by affirmatively opting-in to receive those emails);</li>
<li>using purchased or rented email lists;</li>
<li>using third party email addresses, domain names, or mail servers
without proper permission;</li>

<li>including “<strong>junk mail,</strong>” “<strong>chain letters,</strong>” “<strong>pyramid schemes,</strong>”
incentives (e.g., coupons, discounts, awards, or other incentives)
or other material in any email that encourages a recipient to
forward the Email to another recipient.</li>

</li>
<li>If you or a customer knows of or suspects any violations of the
Email Services Requirements, please notify Shopify at
<a href="mailto:abuse@shopify.com">abuse@shopify.com</a>. Shopify will determine compliance with the
Email Services Requirements in its discretion.</li>

Privacy Policy), the following terms apply to your access to and use of the Shopify Pixel Manager;
a. You will comply with all applicable laws and obtain all necessary
consents from every site visitor and customer whose events you track;

names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other data that personally identifies
an individual, you will obtain all necessary rights and consents prior to
providing Shopify with the foregoing information;
c. You agree that Shopify may disable any pixels that Shopify identifies as
malicious, in Shopify’s sole discretion; and
d. You will not, and will not allow any third parties to, use pixels;
i. to engage in or promote any unlawful, infringing, defamatory or otherwise
harmful activity; or
ii. to disable, interfere with or circumvent any aspect of the Services.</p></li>

<h3 class="text-t5">Which means</h3><p>We welcome customer feedback but are under no obligation to ensure
that ideas and suggestions regarding our Services or the services
of third parties remain confidential and we can use the feedback in
any way we want.</p></aside>

<p>Shopify welcomes any ideas and/or suggestions regarding
improvements or additions to the Services. Under no circumstances
will any disclosure of any idea, suggestion or related material or
any review of the Services, Third Party Services or any Third Party
Provider (collectively, “<strong>Feedback</strong>”) to Shopify be subject to

By submitting Feedback to Shopify (whether submitted directly to
Shopify or posted on any Shopify hosted forum or page), you waive
any and all rights in the Feedback and that Shopify is free to
implement and use the Feedback if desired, as provided by you or as
modified by Shopify, without obtaining permission or license from
you or from any third party. Any reviews of a Third Party Service
or Third Party Provider that you submit to Shopify must be accurate
to the best of your knowledge, and must not be illegal, obscene,
threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of
intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third
parties or objectionable. Shopify reserves the right (but not the
obligation) to remove or edit Feedback of Third Party Services or
Third Party Providers, but does not regularly inspect posted
Feedback.</p><h2 id="11-d-m-c-a-notice-and-takedown-procedure" class="text-t4">11. DMCA Notice and Takedown Procedure</h2><aside>

<h3 class="text-t5">Which means</h3><p>Shopify respects intellectual property rights and you should too.
If we receive a DMCA Notice, we may disable access or remove the
allegedly infringing content from your Store. If you don’t think
the claim is valid, you can send a counter notification. If you
believe one of our merchants is infringing your intellectual
property rights, you can send Shopify a DMCA Notice. We will
expeditiously disable access or remove the content and notify the
merchant.</p></aside>

<p>Shopify supports the protection of intellectual property and asks
Shopify merchants to do the same. It’s our policy to respond to all
notices of alleged copyright infringement. If someone believes that
one of our merchants is infringing their intellectual property
rights, they can send a DMCA Notice to Shopify’s designated agent
using our form. Upon receiving a DMCA Notice, we may remove or
disable access to the Materials claimed to be a copyright
infringement. Once provided with a notice of takedown, the merchant
can reply with a counter notification using our form if they object
to the complaint. The original complainant has 14 business days
after we receive a counter notification to seek a court order
restraining the merchant from engaging in the infringing activity,
otherwise we restore the material. Learn more at

<h3 class="text-t5">Which means</h3><p>If we make a material change to the Terms of Service that
adversely affects your rights under the Terms of Service or your
use of our Services in a material way, we will notify you in
advance (unless the change relates to legal requirements or to
prevent abuse of our Services, among other things).</p></aside>

<ol>
<li><p>We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to
update or change any portion of the Terms of Service at any time.
We will provide you with reasonable advance notice of changes to
the Terms of Service that materially adversely affect your use of
the Services or your rights under the Terms of Service by sending
an email to the Primary Email Address, providing notice through the
Shopify administrative console, or by similar means. However,
Shopify may make changes that materially adversely affect your use
of the Services or your rights under the Terms of Service at any
time and with immediate effect (i) for legal, regulatory, fraud and
abuse prevention, or security reasons; or (ii) to restrict products
or activities that we deem unsafe, inappropriate, or offensive.
Unless we indicate otherwise in our notice (if applicable), any
changes to the Terms of Service will be effective immediately upon
posting of such updated terms at this location. Your continued
access to or use of the Services after we provide such notice, if
applicable, or after we post such updated terms, constitutes your
acceptance of the changes and consent to be bound by the Terms of
Service as amended. If you do not agree to the amended Terms of
Service, you must stop accessing and using the Services.</p></li>
<li><p>Shopify may change the Fees for the Services from

prior to any changes in Fees by sending an email to the Primary
Email Account, providing notice through the Shopify administrative
console, or by similar means. Shopify will not be liable to you or

<h2 id="16-general-conditions" class="text-t4">16. General Conditions</h2><ol>
<li><p>The Terms of Service, including the documents it incorporates by
reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Shopify
and govern your use of the Services and your Account, superseding
any prior agreements between you and Shopify (including, but not
limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p></li>
<li><p>The failure of Shopify to exercise or enforce any right or
provision of the Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of
such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service,
including all terms and conditions and other documents it
incorporates by reference, is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be changed
and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the
original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law, and the
remaining provision of the Terms of Service will remain in full
force and effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Save for Shopify and its affiliates, you or anyone accessing
Shopify Services pursuant to these Terms of Service, unless
otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, no person or entity
who is not a party to these Terms of Service will have any right to
enforce any term of these Terms of Service, regardless of whether
such person or entity has been identified by name, as a member of a
class or as answering a particular description. For the avoidance
of doubt, this will not affect the rights of any permitted assignee
or transferee of these Terms.</p></li>
<li><p>The Terms of Service will be governed by and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of
Canada applicable therein, without regard to principles of
conflicts of laws.</p></li>
<li><p>The Terms of Service may be available in languages other than
English. To the extent of any inconsistencies or conflicts between
these English Terms of Service and Shopify’s Terms of Service
available in another language, the most current English version of
the Terms of Service at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup">https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup</a> will prevail. Any disputes
arising out of these Terms of Service will be resolved in English
unless otherwise determined by Shopify (acting in its sole
discretion) or as required by applicable law.</p></li>
<li><p>All the terms and provisions of the Terms of Service will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to the Terms
of Service and to their respective heirs, successors, permitted
assigns and legal representatives. Shopify will be permitted to
assign these Terms of Service without notice to you or consent from
you. You will have no right to assign or otherwise transfer the
Terms of Service, or any of your rights or obligations hereunder,
to any third party without Shopify’s prior written consent, to be
given or withheld in Shopify’s sole discretion.</p></li>
<li><p>If any provision, or portion of the provision, in these Terms of
Service is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, then such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision (or the
unaffected portion of the provision) of the Terms of Service, and
the Terms of Service will be construed as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision, or portion of the provision, had never
been contained within the Terms of Service.</p></li>
<li><p>On termination, all related rights and obligations under the
Terms of Service immediately terminate, except that (a) you will
remain responsible for performing all of your obligations in
connection with transactions entered into before termination and
for any liabilities that accrued before or as a result of
termination; and Sections 1 (Account Terms), 5 (Payment of Fees), 6
(Confidentiality), 7 (Limitation of Liability and Indemnification),
8.1 (Intellectual Property and Your Materials), 9.7(8)-(10) (Third
Party Services, Experts, and Experts Marketplace), 10 (Feedback and
Reviews), 12 (Privacy and Data Protection), 13 (Shopify Contracting
Party), 14 (Cancellation and Termination), 15(1) (Modifications),
and 16 (General Conditions) will survive the termination or
expiration of these Terms of Service.</p></li>

You are the seller of record for all\n   items you sell through the Services. You are responsible for the\n   creation and operation of your Shopify Store, your Materials, the\n   goods and services that you may sell through the Services, and all\n   aspects of the transactions between you and your customer(s).

If we are unable to process payment of Fees\nusing your payment method, we may make subsequent attempts to\nprocess payment of Fees using your payment method.

Together, the Subscription\n   Fees, Transaction Fees and the Additional Fees are referred to as\n   the “**Fees**”.\n2. You must keep a valid payment method on file with us to pay for all\n   incurred and recurring Fees. Shopify will charge applicable Fees to\n   any valid payment method that you authorize (“**Authorized Payment\n   Method**”), and Shopify will continue to charge the Authorized\n   Payment Method for applicable Fees until the Services are\n   terminated, and any and all outstanding Fees have been paid in\n   full. Unless otherwise indicated, all Fees and other charges are in\n   U.S. dollars, and all payments will be in U.S. currency.\n3. Subscription Fees are paid in advance and will be billed in 30 day\n   intervals (each such date, a “**Billing Date**”). Transaction Fees and\n   Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at Shopify’s\n   discretion. You will be charged on each Billing Date for all\n   outstanding Fees that have not previously been charged. Fees will\n   appear on an invoice, which will be sent to the Store Owner via the\n   Primary Email Address provided. As well, an invoice will appear on\n   the Account page of your Store’s administrative console. Users have\n   approximately two weeks to bring up and settle any issues with the\n   billing of Subscription Fees.\n4. If we are not able to process payment of Fees using an Authorized\n   Payment Method, we may make subsequent attempts to process payment\n   using any Authorized Payment Method. If we are unable to successfully\n   process payment of Fees using an Authorized Payment Method within\n   28 days of our initial attempt, we may suspend and revoke access\n   to your Account and the Services. Your Account will be reactivated\n   upon your payment of any outstanding Fees, plus the Fees applicable\n   to your next billing cycle. You may not be able to access your Account\n   or your storefront during any period of suspension. If the outstanding\n   Fees remain unpaid for 60 days following the date of suspension,\n   Shopify reserves the right to terminate your Account in accordance\n   with Section 14.\n5. All Fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state,\n   local or other governmental sales, goods and services (including\n   Goods and Sales Tax under the Goods and Services Tax Act, Chapter\n   117A of Singapore), harmonized or other taxes, fees or charges now\n   in force or enacted in the future (“**Taxes**”).\n6. You are responsible for all applicable Taxes that arise from or as\n   a result of your subscription to or purchase of Shopify’s products\n   and services. To the extent that Shopify charges these Taxes, they\n   are calculated using the tax rates that apply based on the billing\n   address you provide to us. Such amounts are in addition to the Fees\n   for such products and services and will be billed to your\n   Authorized Payment Method. If you are exempt from payment of such\n   Taxes, you must provide us with evidence of your exemption, which\n   in some jurisdictions includes an original certificate that\n   satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt\n   status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we\n   receive evidence satisfactory to Shopify of your exemption. If you\n   are not charged Taxes by Shopify, you are responsible for\n   determining if Taxes are payable, and if so, self-remitting Taxes\n   to the appropriate tax authorities in your jurisdiction.\n7. For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by you to Shopify\n   under these Terms of Service will be paid free and clear of any\n   deductions or withholdings whatsoever. Other than Taxes charged by\n   Shopify to you and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities on\n   your behalf, any deductions or withholdings that are required by\n   law will be borne by you and paid separately to the relevant\n   taxation authority. Shopify will be entitled to charge the full\n   amount of Fees stipulated under these Terms of Service to your\n   Authorized Payment Method ignoring any such deduction or\n   withholding that may be required.\n8. You are solely responsible for determining, collecting,\n   withholding, reporting, and remitting applicable taxes, duties,\n   fees, surcharges and additional charges that arise from or as a\n   result of any sale on your Shopify Store or your use of the\n   Services.

If any provision of the Terms of Service,\n   including all terms and conditions and other documents it\n   incorporates by reference, is held by a court of competent\n   jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be changed\n   and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the\n   original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law, and the\n   remaining provision of the Terms of Service will remain in full\n   force and effect.\n\n3. Save for Shopify and its affiliates, you or anyone accessing\n   Shopify Services pursuant to these Terms of Service, unless\n   otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, no person or entity\n   who is not a party to these Terms of Service will have any right to\n   enforce any term of these Terms of Service, regardless of whether\n   such person or entity has been identified by name, as a member of a\n   class or as answering a particular description. For the avoidance\n   of doubt, this will not affect the rights of any permitted assignee\n   or transferee of these Terms.\n\n4. The Terms of Service will be governed by and interpreted in\n   accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of\n   Canada applicable therein, without regard to principles of\n   conflicts of laws.\n\n5. The Terms of Service may be available in languages other than\n   English. To the extent of any inconsistencies or conflicts between\n   these English Terms of Service and Shopify’s Terms of Service\n   available in another language, the most current English version of\n   the Terms of Service at https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup will prevail. Any disputes\n   arising out of these Terms of Service will be resolved in English\n   unless otherwise determined by Shopify (acting in its sole\n   discretion) or as required by applicable law.\n\n6. All the terms and provisions of the Terms of Service will be\n   binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to the Terms\n   of Service and to their respective heirs, successors, permitted\n   assigns and legal representatives. Shopify will be permitted to\n   assign these Terms of Service without notice to you or consent from\n   you. You will have no right to assign or otherwise transfer the\n   Terms of Service, or any of your rights or obligations hereunder,\n   to any third party without Shopify’s prior written consent, to be\n   given or withheld in Shopify’s sole discretion.\n\n7. If any provision, or portion of the provision, in these Terms of\n   Service is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal or\n   unenforceable in any respect, then such invalidity, illegality or\n   unenforceability will not affect any other provision (or the\n   unaffected portion of the provision) of the Terms of Service, and\n   the Terms of Service will be construed as if such invalid, illegal\n   or unenforceable provision, or portion of the provision, had never\n   been contained within the Terms of Service.\n\n8. On termination, all related rights and obligations under the\n   Terms of Service immediately terminate, except that (a) you will\n   remain responsible for performing all of your obligations in\n   connection with transactions entered into before termination and\n   for any liabilities that accrued before or as a result of\n   termination; and Sections 1 (Account Terms), 5 (Payment of Fees), 6\n   (Confidentiality), 7 (Limitation of Liability and Indemnification),\n   8.1 (Intellectual Property and Your Materials), 9.7(8)-(10) (Third\n   Party Services, Experts, and Experts Marketplace), 10 (Feedback and\n   Reviews), 12 (Privacy and Data Protection), 13 (Shopify Contracting\n   Party), 14 (Cancellation and Termination), 15(1) (Modifications),\n   and 16 (General Conditions) will survive the termination or\n   expiration of these Terms of Service.\n\n---\n\nShopify Inc.\u003cbr/\u003e\n151 O’Connor Street, Ground floor\u003cbr/\u003e\nOttawa, ON K2P

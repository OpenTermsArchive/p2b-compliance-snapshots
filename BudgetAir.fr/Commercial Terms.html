<p>2.1 <u>Accommodation Information</u></p>

The Accommodation Information shall not contain references or links to the Accommodation or to third parties, including telephone or fax numbers, email (including skype or similar) address, social media, website, app or platform. Booking.com reserves the right to edit or exclude any information that is incorrect or incomplete or in violation of the Agreement.</p>
<p>2.1.2 The Accommodation represents and covenants that the Accommodation Information shall at all times be true, accurate and not misleading. The Accommodation is responsible for a correct and up-to-date statement of the Accommodation Information, including additional availability of rooms for certain periods or any extraordinary events and situations (e.g. renovation or construction at or near the facility). The Accommodation shall update the Accommodation Information on a daily basis (or such more frequent basis as may be required) directly online through the Extranet, through a Connectivity Provider (as applicable and available) or such other way as Booking.com may indicate from time to time. Changes, updates and/or amendments to photos and descriptions will be processed by Booking.com as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>2.1.3 The information provided by the Accommodation for the Platform shall remain the exclusive property of the Accommodation. Information provided by the Accommodation may be edited or modified by Booking.com and subsequently translated into other languages. The translations will remain the exclusive property of Booking.com. The edited and translated content will be for the exclusive use by Booking.com on the Platform and shall not be used in any way or form by the Accommodation for any other distribution or sales channel or purposes. Changes or updates to the descriptive information of the Accommodation are not permitted without Booking.com’s prior written approval.</p>
<p>2.1.4 The Accommodation shall not misuse the service and system of Booking.com by uploading or using excessive or extortionate rates or conditions, or in any way taking action that has the intent or the result of ‘free riding’ on Booking.com’s significant investment in the Platform and/or the Booking.com brand.</p>
<p>2.2 <u>Parity</u></p>
<p>2.2.1 The Accommodation shall give Booking.com "<strong>Rate and Conditions Parity</strong>", meaning the same or better rates for the same Accommodation, room type, dates, bed type, number of guests, same or better amenities and add-ons (e.g. free breakfast, wifi, early/late check-out), and the same or better restrictions and policies such as reservation changes and cancellation policy as are made available by the Accommodation.</p>
<p>2.2.2 Rate and Conditions Parity does not apply in respect of rates and conditions:</p>
<p>(i) offered through any online reservation service that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Accommodation or the chain (whether integrated or not) to which the Accommodation belongs;</p>
<p>(ii) offered on offline channels that do not involve the use of the internet (such as reservations made in person at the Accommodation's reception, by telephoning the Accommodation, or at a bricks and mortar travel agency), provided that the Room Prices are not Published Online or Marketed Online; or</p>
<p>(iii) that are Unpublished, provided that these room rates are not Marketed Online.</p>
<p>2.2.3 The Parties acknowledge that the intent of Clauses 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 is to ensure that the rates and conditions posted on the Platform are competitive, so that Guests benefit from lowered search costs, and so as to prevent the Accommodation from ‘free riding’ on the significant investments made by Booking.com.</p>
<p>2.2.4 Booking.com may give an incentive with respect to the Room Price at its own cost. In such case Booking.com shall pay part of the Room Price on behalf of the Guest.</p>
<p>2.2.5 The Accommodation agrees to give, for each calendar date and subject to availability, some availability for all rooms and room types and is encouraged to provide Booking.com with fair access to all rooms and room types (including various applicable policies and restrictions) and rates available during the term of the Agreement, during periods of low and high demand including during fairs, congresses and special events.</p>

Clauses 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 do not apply to Accommodations (meaning properties) located in No Parity Countries.</p>

<p>2.3.1 For each reservation made through the Platform by a Guest for a Room, the Accommodation shall pay Booking.com a commission (the "<strong>Commission</strong>") calculated in accordance with Clause 2.3.2. Payment shall be made in accordance with Clause 2.4.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The aggregate Commission per reservation is equal to the multiple of:</p>
<p>(i) the number of nights stayed at the Accommodation by the Guest;</p>
<p>(ii) the Room Price per room per night (including Taxes) and such other extras and surcharges which are included in, in addition to, or part of the offered rate or opted into or accepted through the Platform by the Guest prior to the Guest’s check-in (such as breakfasts, meals (half-board or full-board), bicycle rental, late check-out/early check-in fees, extra person charges, resort fees, roll-away beds, theatre tickets, service fees, etc.);</p>
<p>(iii) the number of rooms booked by the Guest; and</p>
<p>(iv) the relevant Commission percentage as set out in the Agreement (plus Taxes and other government charges if applicable).</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Accommodation agrees that, where the Room Price is paid by the Guest to the Accommodation in accordance with Clause 4.4 (Facilitated Payment), Booking.com shall calculate the Commission in the event of no-show or cancellation in accordance with the Facilitated Payment Terms (as set out in Annex 3). In all other events Commission will be charged in the event of:</p>
<p>(i) overbooking: at all times, irrespective of waiver (whether successful or unsuccessful) of charged Room Price; and/or</p>
<p>(ii) a charged cancellation and/or charged no-show.</p>
<p>The Commission will be calculated in accordance with the confirmed booking as provided to the Accommodation and confirmed by Booking.com to the Guest.</p>
<p>2.3.4 The Accommodation shall give Booking.com notice of waiver of any (room) charge or fee in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation, and notice of any invalid payment method for any no-show reservation or cancelled reservation, within 48 hours after midnight on the day of the scheduled date of check-out. Booking.com will then inform the Guest accordingly and the Accommodation shall promptly process the refund to the Guest (as applicable).</p>
<p>2.3.5 The Accommodation is responsible for informing Booking.com about (and any changes to) applicable Taxes (unless applicable mandatory law provides otherwise) which will be charged to the Guest by the Accommodation upon reservation for pre-paid or upon check-out for post-paid reservations. Unless otherwise agreed by Booking.com or permitted by applicable law, the rate shown to Guests on the Platform shall be inclusive of Taxes.</p>
<p>2.3.6 If the law, rules and legislation applicable to the Accommodation demand that rates must be shown to Guests inclusive of Taxes, the Accommodation shall adjust the rates as soon as possible, and in any event within 5 business days after the earlier of:</p>
<p>(i) the amendment or entry into force of the relevant law, rules or legislation applicable to such Accommodation; and</p>
<p>(ii) notification by Booking.com.</p>
<p>2.3.7 The Extranet details all reservations made at the Accommodation through the Platform and the corresponding Commission. After the end of each month, Booking.com shall use best efforts to make an online reservation statement (the "<strong>Online Reservation Statement</strong>") available to the Accommodation on the Extranet, showing the reservations of all Guests whose date of departure fell in the previous month.</p>
<p>2.4 <u>Payments to Booking.com</u></p>
<p>2.4.1 Commission shall be invoiced and paid the calendar month after the (scheduled) departure date of the Guest unless:</p>
<p>(i) the Accommodation has agreed to waive charging the Room Price in accordance with Clause 2.3.4; or</p>
<p>(ii) a free cancellation has been made through Booking.com in accordance with the Accommodation’s cancellation policy.</p>
<p>2.4.2 Commission shall be paid in accordance with the following terms:</p>
<p>(i) invoices are processed on a monthly basis and shall be made available to the Accommodation through the Extranet. Booking.com may also send the invoices by e-mail to the Accommodation;</p>
<p>(ii) the Accommodation shall pay the invoice within 14 days of the invoice date;</p>
<p>(iii) payment shall be made by the Accommodation directly to Booking.com through Facilitated Payment (if applicable) or Direct Debit or, if Direct Debit is not available, by wire transfer to the bank account identified by Booking.com. Booking.com may from time to time settle the invoice (in whole or in part) in accordance with Clause 4.4. Other means of payment (such as by cheque or via payment agencies) cannot be processed by Booking.com so will not be accepted unless otherwise indicated by Booking.com. The Accommodation shall bear all bank charges for the transfer of the funds;</p>
<p>(iv) all Commission payments shall be made in cleared funds without any deduction or set-off in respect of any Taxes, imports, duties or withholdings of any nature, whether imposed by a governmental, fiscal or other authority now or in the future. If the Accommodation is compelled to make any such deduction or withholding it shall pay to Booking.com all additional amounts necessary to ensure receipt by Booking.com of the full (net) amount as specified in the invoice, that Booking.com would have received but for the deduction. The Accommodation is responsible and liable for the payment of any Taxes, imports, duties and withholdings over and above the full (net) Commission payment due from the Accommodation to Booking.com;</p>
<p>(v) the Commission invoiced by Booking.com shall be paid by the Accommodation in the currency (and if applicable at the exchange rate) specified in the invoice. Booking.com may at its sole discretion prepare invoices in either a major currency (e.g. EUR or USD) or the local currency of the Accommodation. The exchange rate used shall be the interbank rate (closing rate as at 16.00 EST) on the last day of the month to which the invoice period relates as used or promulgated by major international financial banks or service companies from time to time selected by Booking.com.</p>
<p>2.4.3 The Accommodation is responsible for withholding and reporting all Taxes due in relation to the Commission according to the relevant tax regulations and the practices and requests of the tax authorities. The Accommodation shall bear and be responsible for the payment and remittance of the Taxes applicable to the Commission and any associated late payment interest and penalties imposed by the tax authority for failing to withhold and report any Taxes applicable to the Commission. If required, the Accommodation shall be solely responsible for negotiating and agreeing with the relevant tax authorities in relation to the tax treatment of the Commission and any other payments. The Accommodation shall provide Booking.com with copies of tax payment certificates and/or tax exemption certificates upon each remittance of the Commission, at Booking.com’s request.</p>
<p>2.4.4 If there is a dispute between Booking.com and the Accommodation (e.g. on the amount of the Commission), the Accommodation shall pay any undisputed part of the Commission in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, notwithstanding the status or nature of the dispute.</p>
<p>2.4.5 If the Accommodation is late in its payment to Booking.com, Booking.com may claim statutory interest, suspend its service under the Agreement (e.g. by suspending the Accommodation from the Platform) and/or require Facilitated Payments, Direct Debit, a deposit, a bank guarantee or some other form of financial security from the Accommodation.</p>
<p>2.4.6 The Accommodation shall pay a deposit to Booking.com equal to a minimum of the sum of the three highest invoices for Commission due or paid to Booking.com in the prior 12 months or such other amount as reasonably determined by Booking.com at its discretion and request (the "<strong>Deposit</strong>"). The Deposit will be held by Booking.com as security for performance of the payment and other obligations of the Accommodation under the Agreement. After the Agreement has terminated, Booking.com will repay the Deposit (or any balance remaining after deducting outstanding Commission, shortfall payments and other costs due to Booking.com) to the Accommodation. The remaining Deposit will be repaid to the Accommodation within 30 days after settlement in full of any of the Accommodation’s outstanding obligations and liabilities (including payment of the outstanding Commission). If the outstanding Commission exceeds the Deposit or if the Accommodation frequently fails to pay the Commission when due, Booking.com may request (and the Accommodation shall pay) an appropriate additional amount as reasonably specified by Booking.com. Booking.com will monitor the (payment) performance of the Accommodation and may repay the Deposit to the Accommodation at Booking.com’s discretion. The amount of the Deposit does not limit or cap the liability of the Accommodation under the Agreement. The Deposit shall not bear any interest.</p>
<p>2.5 <u>Reservation, Guest Reservation, Complaints & We Price Match</u></p>
<p>2.5.1 The Accommodation will receive a confirmation for every reservation made by a Guest through the Platform. The confirmation will include the Customer Data, which includes but is not limited to all Guest Personal Data. Booking.com is not responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information (including credit card details) and dates provided by the Guests. Booking.com is not responsible for the payment obligations of the Guests relating to their reservations. The Accommodation shall on a regular basis (at least daily) check and verify the status of reservations on the Extranet, through its Connectivity Provider (as applicable and available) or such other way as Booking.com may indicate from time to time. Credit card details are only kept by Booking.com for a limited period of time.</p>
<p>2.5.2 By making a reservation through the Platform a direct legal contract is created between the Accommodation and the Guest (the "<strong>Guest Reservation</strong>"). Booking.com is not a party to this contract. Booking.com acts as a mandatary for Accommodations (meaning properties) located in France.</p>
<p>2.5.3 The Accommodation must accept a Guest as its contractual counterparty and must handle the online reservation in compliance with the Accommodation Information contained on the Platform at the time the reservation was made and the supplementary information and wishes (if any) were made known by the Guest.</p>
<p>2.5.4 Other than the fees, extras and charges set out in the reservation confirmation sent by Booking.com to the Guest, the Accommodation shall not charge the Guest any transaction or administration fee or charge for the use of any payment method (e.g. credit card charge).</p>
<p>2.5.5 Complaints or claims in respect of the products or service provided by the Accommodation or specific requests made by Guests shall be managed by the Accommodation without requiring the involvement of Booking.com. Booking.com is not responsible for and has no liability in respect of such complaints or claims. Booking.com may at its sole discretion:</p>
<p>(i) offer customer (support) services to a Guest;</p>
<p>(ii) act as intermediary between the Accommodation and a Guest; and</p>
<p>(iii) provide at the Accommodation’s expense alternative accommodation of an equal or better standard in the event of an overbooking or other material irregularity or complaint in relation to the Accommodation.</p>
<p>2.5.6 Where Booking.com is entitled to Rate and Conditions Parity or Rate Parity and a Guest has a valid claim under We Price Match, Booking.com shall promptly notify the Accommodation of the relevant details of the claim. The Accommodation shall immediately adjust the rates available on the Platform so that the lower rate is available for further bookings. The Accommodation shall also immediately adjust the rate in the reservation made by the Guest who brought the claim. When the Guest checks-out, the Accommodation shall offer the room at the lower rate and shall either (i) settle the difference between the booked rate and the lower rate by charging the Guest for the lower rate, or (ii) refund (in cash) the Guest the difference between the two rates.</p>
<p>2.5.7 Clause 2.5.6 does not apply to Accommodations (meaning properties) located in No Parity Countries.</p>
<p>2.6 <u>Overbooking & Cancellation</u></p>
<p>2.6.1 The Accommodation shall provide the Guest with the rooms booked. If the Accommodation is unable to meet its obligations under the Agreement for any reason, it shall promptly inform Booking.com via customer service (customer.service@booking.com) in accordance with the Booking.com overbooking procedure as set out in the Partner Support Center. Unless Booking.com has arranged for (and the Accommodation has verified) alternative accommodation, the Accommodation will use its best endeavours to provide an alternative room(s) of equal or superior quality at its own expense. If no such room is available on arrival, the Accommodation will:</p>
<p>(i) find suitable alternative accommodation of an equal or superior standard to the Accommodation holding the Guest‘s guaranteed booking;</p>
<p>(ii) provide free private transportation to the alternative accommodation for the Guest and other members of the Guest's party who are listed in the Guest's guaranteed booking; and</p>
<p>(iii) reimburse and compensate Booking.com and/or the Guest for all reasonable costs and expenses (e.g. costs of the alternative accommodation, transportation, telephone costs) incurred by the Guest and/or Booking.com as a result of the overbooking. Any sum due to Booking.com under this Clause 2.6.1 shall be paid by the Accommodation within 14 days after receipt of the invoice.</p>
<p>2.6.2 The Accommodation may not cancel any online reservation. Where any fraudulent activities are alleged or suspected (e.g. in respect of reservations, credit card fraud, money laundering or payment of the Room Price), Booking.com may cancel the relevant reservation. Where Facilitated Payment has been used, Booking.com may withhold, suspend or cancel the transfer of any associated funds to the Accommodation, or execute a chargeback of the relevant funds from the Accommodation. Booking.com shall inform the Accommodation of any action that it takes pursuant to this Clause 2.6.2.</p>
<p>2.6.3 Cancellations made by Guests before the point at which a cancellation fee applies will not attract Commission. Cancellations made by Guests after this point will attract Commission in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p>2.7 <u>Credit Cards</u></p>
<p>2.7.1 This Clause 2.7 is not applicable to reservations paid through Facilitated Payment. Credit card details must be provided to the Accommodation in order to guarantee the reservation. The Accommodation shall at all times accept all major credit cards (including MasterCard, Visa and American Express) to guarantee a reservation. The Accommodation is responsible for the verification of the validity of the credit card details, the (pre) authorization of the credit card and for confirming that the limit of credit on the date of the overnight stay booked is sufficient.

<h4>FACILITATED PAYMENT TERMS FOR ALL TRANSACTIONS EXCEPT THOSE TO WHICH ANNEX 3B OR 3C APPLIES</h4>
<p>1. <u>Scope, Definitions & Interpretation</u></p>
<p>1.1 This Annex 3A forms an integral part of the Agreement and must be read in conjunction with the Agreement. Except as otherwise provided for in this Annex 3A, the terms and conditions of the Agreement remain unchanged and in full force and effect.</p>

<p>2. <u>Facilitated Payment</u></p>
<p>2.1 Booking.com may offer Facilitated Payment services. Booking.com may from time to time engage a third party to facilitate and process payments under the Facilitated Payment (the "<strong>Payment Processor</strong>"). Booking.com contracts with Payment Processors for the purposes of collecting payments from Guests and transferring funds to and settling funds with Accommodations.</p>
<p>2.2 Any payment made by a Guest to Booking.com or a Payment Processor as agent for the Accommodation shall satisfy and discharge a corresponding amount of the Guest's debt to the Accommodation. Booking.com may, to the extent permitted by law, charge or require compensation from the Accommodation for costs and expenses, plus Taxes (if applicable), for and related to the Facilitated Payment service and the underlying payment transaction (including the fees, costs and other amounts as charged by its payment processors, banks or credit card companies for such transaction) (the "<strong>Facilitated Payment Fees</strong>"). The Accommodation shall pay the Facilitated Payment Fees in accordance with the terms of the invoice.</p>
<p>2.3 If Booking.com (via the Payment Processor) fails to transfer any funds due to the Accommodation under the Facilitated Payment, the Accommodation will have recourse only against Booking.com and not against the Guest directly.</p>
<p>3. <u>Room Price</u></p>
<p>3.1 The Room Price will be collected and processed by the Payment Processor, in accordance with the payment policy of the Accommodation (to the extent applicable) as disclosed on the Platform.</p>
<p>3.2 The Accommodation shall not charge, request payment of or collect any amount from the Guest that has not already been included in the Room Price, unless Booking.com has indicated that certain Taxes, fees, charges, add-ons (e.g. breakfast) or other amounts are not included in the Room Price (the "<strong>Excluded Elements</strong>").</p>
<p>3.3 The Room Price shall be transferred by Booking.com to the Accommodation, subject to the rules set out in Clauses 3.3, 3.4 and 6.1 to 8.1 of this Annex. One of the following amounts, as agreed between the Parties from time to time, will be transferred to the Accommodation:</p>
<p>(i) the balance of the Room Price minus due and outstanding Commission (if permitted), fees, costs and expenses and other amounts due to Booking.com, or the equivalent thereof in another currency (the "<strong>Net Amount</strong>"); or</p>
<p>(ii) the Room Price minus amounts that Booking.com is required to withhold under local laws or regulations, or the equivalent thereof in another currency (the "<strong>Gross Amount</strong>").</p>
<p>3.4 The transfer may be effected by bank transfer (in which case, the Net Amount or the Gross Amount shall be transferred), by providing the Accommodation with a virtual credit card (the "<strong>Virtual Card</strong>") (in which case, only the Gross Amount shall be transferred), or as otherwise communicated in writing by Booking.com.</p>
<p>4. <u>Use of Facilitated Payment Funds</u></p>
<p>4.1 Booking.com may from time to time use the Facilitated Payment and/or other (online) payment methods such as virtual credit cards for:</p>
<p>(i) (pre) payment of the Room Price by the Guest to the Accommodation through the Payment Processor;</p>
<p>(ii) settlement and/or payment of any Commission, Facilitated Payment Fees and/or other amounts due to Booking.com from the Accommodation; and</p>
<p>(iii) offsetting any Commission, Facilitated Payment Fees and/or other amounts due to Booking.com from the Accommodation against the Room Price processed at any time through the Payment Processor.</p>
<p>4.2 If there are insufficient funds to settle and pay all amounts due to Booking.com, Booking.com may collect the deficit from the Accommodation by Direct Debit (if available), or offset it against the Deposit (if applicable) or instruct the Accommodation which shall upon first request of Booking.com pay the deficit to the bank account as from time to time identified by Booking.com.</p>
<p>5. <u>Taxes</u></p>
<p>5.1 Unless mandatory local law requires otherwise, the Accommodation shall be responsible for the collection, remittance, withholding and payment to the relevant (tax) authorities (as applicable) of:</p>
<p>(i) the relevant Taxes and extras in addition to the Room Price (including the relevant Taxes, extras and amounts not included in the Room Price); and</p>
<p>(ii) the Taxes on the Commission.</p>
<p>5.2 If pursuant to Clause 4.1 of this Annex, Booking.com uses the Room Price collected from a Guest (as the limited purpose agent of the Accommodation) for the settlement and payment of any Commission, Facilitated Payment Fees and/or other amount due and outstanding from the Accommodation, the Accommodation shall nevertheless remit an amount equal to the full amount of tax collected as part of the Room Price to the appropriate tax authority.</p>
<p>6. <u>General Rules Related to Any Transfer</u></p>
<p>6.1 Booking.com may without notice suspend payment of the Net Amount or Gross Amount if it suspects fraud or other illegality associated with the transaction. Guest reservations involving alleged or suspected fraud will be cancelled. Where a non-refundable Guest reservation is cancelled in accordance with this Clause 6.1, the Accommodation will still be paid provided there is no alleged or suspected involvement of the Accommodation.</p>
<p>6.2 Notwithstanding Clause 6.1, payment of the Net Amount or Gross Amount may be suspended if Booking.com suspects a breach of the Agreement by the Accommodation.</p>
<p>6.3 Any Net Amount or Gross Amount held by a bank, Payment Processor or third party in accordance with this Annex shall not accrue interest.</p>
<p>6.4 If the Accommodation lists a Room Price in a specified currency it shall receive that amount in that currency. If the Accommodation tries to accept settlement or payment of the Room Price into an account with a different currency denomination to the Room Price or otherwise attempts its own currency conversion of the settlement amount, the Accommodation shall bear all currency exchange risk, including conversion of the Room Price. The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that due to fluctuating currency exchange rates and costs/fees charged by banks, credit card companies and other intermediaries for the collection, processing and payment of the relevant amounts, there may be differences between the Room Price (as uploaded by the Accommodation in the system), the collected amount and the amount received by the Accommodation.</p>
<p>6.5 If Booking.com is required by law, court order, (semi-)governmental instruction or order, arbitrational decision (or similar ruling), subpoena or cancellation policy to make a refund of all or part of the Room Price to the Guest, or if it reasonably believes that the Accommodation has engaged in fraudulent activities, Booking.com reserves the right to claim from the Accommodation repayment of such amount (re)paid to Guest but received by the Accommodation. Payment by the Accommodation under this Clause 6.5 shall be made within 14 days of the request by Booking.com.</p>
<p>6.6 Where the Accommodation agrees to a refund of a fully or partially paid non-refundable Room Price (or part thereof), Booking.com may settle the relevant amount with the Guest on behalf of the Accommodation. Where the relevant amount has already been transferred to the Accommodation in accordance with this Annex, the Accommodation shall repay the relevant amount to Booking.com in the manner reasonably requested by Booking.com. Where the relevant amount has not been transferred to the Accommodation in accordance with this Annex, Booking.com shall not transfer and/or may stop the transfer of the relevant amount.</p>
<p>6.7 Booking.com may charge Commission on the Room Price collected and transferred to the Accommodation in the event of a no-show or cancellation. In the event of an overbooking, the Commission shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p>6.8 Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Accommodation shall issue an invoice to the Guest for the full amount of the reservation (including/plus all applicable Taxes as required by applicable laws). The Accommodation shall not invoice (or send an invoice to) Booking.com for the reservation or stay. Nothing in the Agreement shall constitute or imply that Booking.com acts or operates as a principal, merchant or (re)seller of the room.</p>
<p>7. <u>Payment via Virtual Card</u></p>
<p>7.1 The Accommodation may not authorize or charge the Virtual Card until the date on which the Guest’s reservation becomes non-refundable or, without prejudice to Booking.com’s other rights under this Agreement, from such other date as Booking.com may communicate if Booking.com:</p>
<p>(i) seeks to limit its (overall) financial exposure;</p>
<p>(ii) suspects the payment to be at risk of becoming the subject of a chargeback; or</p>
<p>(iii) suspects fraud or other illegality associated with the transaction.</p>
<p>7.2 The Virtual Card is only valid for the reservation, the amount and the currency specified on the confirmation of the reservation to which it was assigned. The Accommodation shall collect the Gross Amount by charging the Virtual Card during the time period ending 12 months after the date of the Guest's check-out (the "<strong>Cut-Off Date</strong>"). Prior to the Cut-Off Date, Booking.com shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform the Accommodation of the Gross Amount or any portion available for collection by the Accommodation. By informing the Accommodation of the (portion of the) Gross Amount that is available for collection by the Accommodation, any obligations that Booking.com may have under applicable law to inform the Accommodation shall be discharged.</p>
<p>7.3 If the Accommodation fails to collect (any portion of) the Gross Amount on or prior to the Cut-off Date, from the Cut-off Date:</p>
<p>(i) the Virtual Card shall be deactivated;</p>
<p>(ii) the Accommodation’s rights and claims to such amount (including any right of set-off) shall automatically cease to exist ; and</p>

The Parties expressly agree that the Gross Amount (or any portion thereof) retained by Booking.com after expiration of the Cut-Off Date does not constitute Commission or other consideration paid by the Accommodation to Booking.com for the provision of Services under the Agreement.</p>

<h4>FACILITATED PAYMENT TERMS FOR ACCOMMODATIONS THAT SIGNED PAYMENT PROCESSING DOCUMENTATION WITH A PAYMENT PROCESSOR THROUGH THE PLATFORM</h4>
<p>1. <u>Scope, Definitions & Interpretation</u></p>
<p>1.1 This Annex 3B forms an integral part of the Agreement and must be read in conjunction with the Agreement. Except as otherwise provided for in this Annex 3B, the terms and conditions of the Agreement remain unchanged and in full force and effect.</p>
<p>1.2 Unless defined otherwise in this Annex 3B, capitalized terms have the same meaning as set out in the Agreement. References in this Annex 3B to Clauses shall mean Clauses in this Annex 3B, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>2.1 The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that Booking.com may offer Facilitated Payment services.</p>
<p>2.2 Booking.com may from time to time allow a third party (the "<strong>Payment Processor</strong>") to operate through the Platform for the purposes of enabling Facilitated Payment. This Annex 3B shall apply if the type of Facilitated Payment arranged involves the Payment Processor:</p>
<p>(i) providing services to, and under a direct contractual relationship with, the Accommodation by acquiring and/or otherwise collecting:</p>
<p>a. payments from Guests on behalf of the Accommodation in respect of those payment methods serviced by the Payment Processor;</p>
<p>b. payments from Booking.com to the Accommodation;</p>

<p>("<strong>Processed Payments</strong>"); and</p>
<p>(ii) paying the Processed Payments directly to the Accommodation or Booking.com (as applicable),</p>
<p>(the "<strong>Payment Processor Services</strong>").</p>
<p>2.3 The Parties acknowledge that Facilitated Payment under this Annex 3B involves:</p>
<p>(i) a separate contractual agreement between the Accommodation and the Payment Processor (the "<strong>Payment Processing Documentation</strong>") to which Booking.com will not be a party; and</p>
<p>(ii) a separate contractual agreement to which the Accommodation is not a party, and pursuant to which Booking.com allows the Payment Processor to offer the Payment Processor Services to Accommodations through the Platform (the "<strong>Booking-Processor Documentation</strong>").</p>
<p>2.4 If the Accommodation elects to use the Payment Processor Services and agrees to be bound by the Payment Processing Documentation:</p>
<p>(i) the Accommodation hereby authorizes Booking.com to perform any steps necessary to effect that choice and to allow the Accommodation to open a new account with the Payment Processor, and/or to integrate any existing account of the Accommodation with the Payment Processor);</p>
<p>(ii) the Accommodation shall use all reasonable endeavours to assist Booking.com in the performance of its obligations in connection with the Facilitated Payment. The Accommodation shall provide such information to or as directed by Booking.com as required for the provision of Facilitated Payment and for the identification of the Accommodation for regulatory reasons (including the prevention of fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing); and</p>
<p>(iii) the Accommodation authorizes Booking.com to share information regarding the Accommodation with the Payment Processor.</p>
<p>2.5 The Accommodation shall provide all information to or as directed by Booking.com, that is required to enable the Payment Processor to make pay-outs in respect of Processed Payments. The Accommodation shall ensure that all information provided by it to Booking.com is complete and accurate, shall bear all losses arising from any incorrect information being provided to Booking.com and shall indemnify Booking.com against all liabilities, losses, costs and expenses which Booking.com may suffer or incur as a result of any such information being incorrect or incomplete. The Accommodation authorizes Booking.com to give instructions to the Payment Processor on behalf of the Accommodation in respect of the collection, processing and pay-out of Processed Payments, including any refunds, reversals, returns, disputes, balance adjustments, chargebacks or other related matters. The Accommodation authorises Booking.com to share these instructions with the Payment Processor.</p>
<p>2.6 The Accommodation shall use the Payment Processor Services only for collecting the Processed Payments, and shall comply with its obligations under the Payment Processing Documentation. The Accommodation shall indemnify Booking.com against all liabilities, losses, costs and expenses which Booking.com may suffer or incur (including but not limited to under the Booking-Processor Documentation) as a result of any failure by the Accommodation to perform any of its obligations when due or as a result of the misuse of any Payment Processor Services by any third party unless such misuse results from the wilful default or negligence of Booking.com, its employees or agents.</p>
<p>2.7 The provision of Payment Processor Services by the Payment Processor to the Accommodation is at the discretion of the Payment Processor and may be withdrawn at any time by the Payment Processor in accordance with the terms of the Payment Processing Documentation. Booking.com shall have no liability for any decision of the Payment Processor not to make or to cease making the Payment Processor Services available to the Accommodation (whether justified or not) or for any breach or delayed performance by the Payment Processor of any obligations owed by it to the Accommodation in respect of the provision of the Payment Processor Services. Booking.com shall have no obligation to ensure that Payment Processor Services are at all times available to the Accommodation.</p>
<p>2.8 Booking.com may at any time give notice to terminate or suspend the availability or operation of Facilitated Payment in whole or in part in the event of any alleged or suspected credit card fraud, sanctions breach or breach of contract in relation to the Accommodation or any Processed Payment. Booking.com and the Payment Processor may share information (subject to each party's privacy and legal obligations) related to any actual or suspected fraud or misuse of the Payment Processor Services.</p>
<p>2.9 Booking.com may (cross) charge to, or require compensation from the Accommodation for any fees, costs or expenses incurred by Booking.com in allowing the provision of the Facilitated Payment and the Payment Processor Services to occur through the Platform, including but not limited to any fees payable under the Booking-Processor Documentation plus Taxes (if applicable). The Payment Processor shall not charge the Accommodation for the Payment Processor Services, unless this is set out in the Payment Processing Documentation. Payment shall be due in accordance with the terms of Booking.com’s invoice and Booking.com is hereby irrevocably authorised by the Accommodation to give an instruction to the Payment Processor for the payment of any such amount to Booking.com from Processed Payments.</p>
<p>2.10 The Accommodation hereby authorizes Booking.com to, from time to time as necessary, instruct the Payment Processor to pay to Booking.com from Processed Payments such amounts as are required to settle the due and outstanding Commission, and/or such other amounts owed by the Accommodation to Booking.com. If there are insufficient funds to settle and pay all amounts due to Booking.com or if Booking.com does not give any such instruction, Booking.com may collect the deficit from the Accommodation by Direct Debit (if available), or offset it against the Deposit (if applicable) or may instruct the Accommodation which shall upon first request of Booking.com pay the deficit to such bank account as from time to time identified by Booking.com.</p>
<p>2.11 The Room Price will be collected and processed by the Payment Processor in accordance with the payment policy of the Accommodation for the relevant reservation as disclosed on the Platform, and with the other provisions of the Agreement, to the extent applicable. The Accommodation agrees and accepts that the Room Price may be paid by the Guest in a different currency to the currency specified in the Accommodation Information.</p>
<p>2.12 If the Accommodation lists a Room Price in a specified currency it shall receive that amount in that currency. If the Accommodation tries to accept settlement or payment of the Room Price into an account with a different currency denomination to the Room Price or otherwise attempts its own currency conversion of the settlement amount, the Accommodation shall bear all currency exchange risk, including conversion of the Room Price. The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that due to fluctuating currency exchange rates and costs/fees charged by banks, credit card companies and other intermediaries for the collection, processing and payment of the relevant amounts, there may be differences between the Room Price (as uploaded by the Accommodation in the system), the collected amount and the amount received by the Accommodation. The Accommodation will not further charge, request payment of or collect any amount from the Guest in respect of any such difference.</p>
<p>2.13 The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that it is at all times responsible for the collection, remittance, withholding and payment of the relevant Taxes on and extras in addition to the Room Price (including the relevant Taxes and extras not included in the Room Price) and Commission, to the relevant tax authorities. The Accommodation shall not further charge, request payment of or collect any amount from the Guest that has not already been included in the Room Price unless it is clearly stated in the Accommodation Information that certain Taxes, add-ons (e.g. breakfast) or other amounts are not included in the Room Price (the "<strong>Excluded Elements</strong>").</p>
<p>2.14 Booking.com may instruct the Payment Processor to cancel or return any Processed Payment or settle the relevant amount with the Guest on behalf of the Accommodation from Booking.com’s own resources, and may instruct the Payment Processor on behalf of the Accommodation to reimburse the Guest for the amount settled from Processed Payments if:</p>
<p>(i) the Accommodation agrees to refund (part of) a fully or partially paid non-refundable Room Price;</p>
<p>(ii) Booking.com is required by any applicable cancellation policy or by law, court order, (quasi-) governmental instruction or order, arbitral decision (or similar ruling) or subpoena to make a refund of all or part of the Room Price; or</p>
<p>(iii) Booking.com determines in its discretion that it is reasonable or fair to a Guest to make a refund of all or part of a Room Price.</p>
<p>2.15 If there are insufficient funds to settle and pay all amounts due to Booking.com in accordance with Clause 2.14, or if Booking.com does not give any such instruction, Booking.com may collect the deficit by Direct Debit (if available), offset it against the Deposit (if applicable) or may instruct the Accommodation which shall upon first request of Booking.com pay the deficit to the bank account as from time to time identified by Booking.com.</p>
<p>2.16 Booking.com may charge Commission on the Room Price collected and transferred to the Accommodation in the event of a no-show or cancellation. In the event of an overbooking, the Commission shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p>2.17 Unless required otherwise by applicable law, the Accommodation shall issue an invoice to the Guest for the full amount of the reservation (including or plus, as required by applicable laws, all applicable Taxes). The Accommodation shall not invoice or send an invoice to Booking.com for the reservation or stay. Nothing in the Agreement shall mean or imply that Booking.com acts or operates as a principal, merchant or (re)seller of the room.</p>
<p>3. Payment via Virtual Card</p>
<p>3.1 If the Payment Processor provides the Accommodation with a virtual credit card (a “<strong>Virtual Card</strong>”) to transfer Processed Payments , then the Accommodation shall collect the Processed Payment by charging the Virtual Card during the time period ending 12 months after the date of the Guest's check-out (the "<strong>Cut-Off Date</strong>"). Prior to the Cut-Off Date, Booking.com shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform the Accommodation of (any portion of) the amount available on the Virtual Card (the “<strong>Virtual Card Balance</strong>”) for collection by the Accommodation. By informing the Accommodation of the Virtual Card Balance that is available for collection by the Accommodation, any obligations that Booking.com and/or the Payment Processor may have under applicable law to inform the Accommodation shall be discharged. If the Accommodation fails to collect the Virtual Card Balance on or prior to the Cut-off Date, from the Cut-off Date:</p>
<p>(i) the Virtual Card shall be deactivated;</p>
<p>(ii) the Accommodation's rights and claims to such amount (including any right of set-off) shall automatically cease to exist; and</p>
<p>(iii) Booking.com shall have full right, title and interest in and to such amount.</p>
<p>3.2 From and after the Cut-off Date, the Accommodation, without further action, hereby releases and forever discharges Booking.com and its Affiliated Companies from any and all claims related to the Virtual Card Balance (explicitly including claims related to (any portion of) the Virtual Card Balance insofar as it has not been collected by the Accommodation prior to the Cut-Off Date). The Parties expressly agree that the Virtual Card Balance (or any portion thereof) retained by Booking.com after expiration of the Cut-Off Date does not constitute Commission or other consideration paid by the Accommodation to Booking.com for the provision of Services under this Agreement.</p>

<p>2. <u>Facilitated Payment</u></p>
<p>2.1 The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that Booking.com may offer Facilitated Payment services.</p>
<p>2.2 Booking.com may from time to time allow a third party (the "<strong>Payment Processor</strong>") to operate on the Platform for the purposes of enabling Facilitated Payment. This Annex 3C shall apply if the Facilitated Payment involves the Payment Processor providing services (the "<strong>Payment Processor Services</strong>") to and under a direct contractual relationship with Guests by (a) collecting payments from Guests in respect of those payment methods serviced by the Payment Processor ("<strong>Processed Payments</strong>"); and (b) paying the amounts collected directly to Accommodations on behalf of Guests.</p>

<p>2.8 In relation to each reservation, the Room Price will be the amount collected from the Guest and processed by the Payment Processor for payment to the Accommodation (insofar as applicable, in accordance with the payment policy of the Accommodation for the relevant reservation as disclosed on the Platform and the other provisions of the Agreement). The Accommodation hereby authorises Booking.com to provide information to the Payment Processor (acting on behalf of the Guest) as to any amounts payable to the Accommodation and when such amounts are due for payment to the Accommodation and in respect of any refunds, reversals, returns, disputes, balance adjustments, chargebacks or other related matters related to any payment.</p>

<p>3.1 The Accommodation agrees and acknowledges that due to fluctuating currency exchange rates and costs/fees charged by banks, credit card companies and other intermediaries for the collection, processing and payment of the relevant amounts, there may be differences between the Room Price (as uploaded by the Accommodation in the Platform), the Processed Payment and the amount received by the Accommodation.</p>
<p>3.2 The Accommodation is at all times responsible for the collection, remittance, withholding and payment to the relevant (tax) authorities (as applicable) of the relevant Taxes on and extras in addition to the Room Price (including the relevant Taxes and extras not included in the Room Price) and remittance, withholding and payment (as applicable) of the Taxes on the Commission, to the relevant tax authorities. Unless the Accommodation clearly indicates in its listing on the Platform that that certain Taxes, add-ons (e.g. breakfast) or other amounts are not included in the Room Price (the "<strong>Excluded Elements</strong>"), the Accommodation shall not further charge, request payment of or collect any amount from the Guest that has not already been included in the Room Price (save for the Excluded Elements (if applicable)).</p>

Nothing in the Agreement shall constitute or imply that Booking.com acts or operates as a principal, merchant or (re)seller of any room.</p>
<p>3.6 Booking.com may, in its absolute discretion, from time to time:</p>
<p>(i) make payment from its own resources of any amount due to be paid to the Accommodation by the Payment Processor (a "<strong>Processor Late Payment</strong>") but which may for any reason be delayed. If this occurs, to the extent of the payment by Booking.com, Accommodation hereby assigns to Booking.com all and any rights it has to receive the relevant Processor Late Payment and directs the Payment Processor to make payment of such Processor Late Payment directly to Booking.com instead of to the Accommodation; and</p>
<p>(ii) make payment to the Payment Processor of any amount due from the Accommodation to the Payment Processor or a Guest (for example, in respect of a refund amount agreed to be due from the Accommodation to the Guest). To the extent that, and by reference to the amount for which, Booking.com does this, the Accommodation shall pay to Booking.com by way of reimbursement the amount which it would otherwise have paid to the Payment Processor.</p>
<p>4. <u>Payment Via Bank Transfer</u></p>
<p>4.1 The Accommodation agrees to provide correct Bank Account details to Booking.com for onward transmission to the Payment Processor for the pay-out of any Processed Payment by bank transfer.

<p>5.2 Where the Accommodation receives payment through Facilitated Payment using a Virtual Card, the Accommodation shall be deemed irrevocably to have received payment from the Guest in full and final settlement at such time as the Virtual Card is authorised and not at the later time of when the Accommodation receives settlement of the payment through its merchant acquirer.</p>
<h3>Annex 4</h3>
<h4>RANKING</h4>
<p>1. Booking.com aims to display search results relevant to each Guest, by providing a personalised default ranking of Accommodations on its Platform. Guests can scroll through this default ranking, use filters and sort by alternative ranking orders and thus have the ability to influence the presentation of search results to receive a ranking order based on other criteria. Booking.com uses multiple algorithms to produce default ranking results, which is a constantly evolving process.</p>
<p>2. Booking.com has identified the following parameters to be most closely correlated with a Guest finding a suitable Accommodation, so prioritises such parameters in the algorithms:</p>
<p>a. the Guest’s personal search history</p>
<p>b. the rate of click through from the search page to the hotel page</p>
<p>c. the number of bookings related to the number of visits to the Accommodation page on the Platform ("<strong>Conversion</strong>")</p>
<p>d. gross (including cancellations) and net (excluding cancellations) bookings of the Accommodation</p>
<p>3. Conversion and click through rate may be affected by various (stand-alone) factors including review scores (both aggregated scores and components), availability, policies, (competitive) pricing, quality of content and certain features of the Accommodation. The Commission percentage paid by the Accommodation or other benefits to Booking.com (e.g. through commercial arrangements with the Accommodation or strategic partners) may also impact the default ranking, as well as the Accommodation’s record on timely payment. The Accommodation can find suggestions as to how to improve Conversion and click through rate on the Extranet.</p>
<p>4. The Accommodation may influence its ranking by participating in programs that Booking.com makes available, such as the Genius loyalty program, deals, the Preferred and Preferred Plus Partner Programs and the Visibility Booster (the latter three involve the Accommodation paying a higher Commission to Booking.com). The range of programs available may change from time to time. The programs and the terms applicable to each of the programs will be kept updated and made available on the Extranet.</p>
<h3>Annex 5</h3>
<h4>WIDE PARITY COUNTRY WORDING</h4>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, to the extent that the Accommodation (meaning property) is located in a Wide Parity Country, the terms and conditions set out below shall apply, replacing the terms in the Agreement with the corresponding numbering. The following Clause 2.2.1 shall replace Clauses 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 in the Agreement:</p>
<p>2.2.1 The Accommodation shall give Booking.com rate and availability parity as defined below:</p>
<p>(i) "<strong>Rate Parity</strong>" means the same or better rates for the same accommodation, same room type, same dates, same bed type, same number of guests, the same or better amenities and add-ons (e.g. free breakfast, wifi, early/late check-out), the same or better restrictions and policies such as reservation changes and cancellation policy as are available on the Accommodation’s websites, apps or call-centres (including the customer reservation system), or directly at the Accommodation, with any competitor of Booking.com (which includes any online or offline reservation or booking agency or intermediary) and/or with any other (online or offline) third party that is a business partner of or in any other way related with or connected to the Accommodation. Rate Parity does not apply in respect of rates intended for a closed user group ("closed user group" means a group with defined limitations where membership is not automatic and where: (a) consumers actively opt in to become a member, (b) any online or mobile interface used by closed user group members is password protected, (c) closed user group members have completed a customer profile, and (d) the consumer to which the rate is offered or made available has already made at least one prior booking as a member of the closed user group) provided that such rates are not (directly or indirectly) publicly (made) available. In the event that a closed user group rate is (directly or indirectly) publicly (made) available (by the Accommodation, a (direct/indirect) competitor of Booking.com or on any third party (platform) (including any (meta) search engine or price comparison website), Booking.com is entitled to Rate Parity for such rate; and</p>
<p>(ii) "<strong>Availability Parity</strong>" means that the Accommodation shall provide Booking.com with such availability (i.e. rooms available for booking at the Platform) that are at least as favourable as those provided to any competitor of Booking.com (which includes any online or offline reservation or booking agency or intermediary) and/or with any other (online or offline) third party that is a business partner of or in any other way related with or connected to the Accommodation.</p>
<p>5.1 (v) the price for the rooms advertised on the Platform corresponds to the best available price for an equivalent stay with the Accommodation and a better price cannot be obtained by a Guest making a reservation with the Accommodation directly or via another (third) party or via another medium or channel, and</p>
<p>6.2.1 (iii) to the extent that any claims under or pursuant to the We Price Match are not settled between the Guest and the Accommodation upon check-out of the Guest (by payment of the lower rate), all claims made by Guests regarding or pursuant to the We Price Match;</p>
